          "The Dattatreya Temple stands at the east end of the Tachapal Tol, a small square on the east side of Bhaktapur. It honors the composite deity Dattatreya, a personification of the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.According to Slusser and Vajrācārya, the temple was originally founded as a sattal, a kind of dharmasala or public rest house sometime in the 15th century. It was functionally similar to the KasthaMandap, an older site in Kathmandu that was destroyed in the April 2015 earthquake and has not yet been rebuilt. Similar legends are told about both buildings: that each was built from the wood of a single tree, and that each was founded on the site of a former island within a small lake, upon which a famous Indian jogi had died. These similar foundation narratives might suggest a desire on the part of the Bhaktapur rulers to     borrow  the mythology of the KasthaMandap, thereby enhancing the prestige of Bhaktapur and their     rival  dharmasala.  Both temples were designed in a similar manner. They were laid out on a square footprint with an equal number of open columns on each side. Morphologically, this form is derived from the Mandap—typically, a modest sixteen-pillared, open-air hall, usually of only one story. At both temples, the Mandap design was employed but was modified and expanded to cover a much larger footprint, and lofted skyward with two additional floors to accommodate greater numbers of itinerant holy men, who might stay at each site for months or even years.  The distinction between a Mandap and a sattal is subtle, with the sattal usually designed for more permanent occupation and with better protection from the elements. But in size and scope, both the Dattatreya and KasthaMandap are more closely aligned with the sattal form than the usually far humbler (and often one-story) Mandap.  The Dattatreya was probably erected between 1428-67, either by King Yaksha Malla (r. 1428-82) or possibly by his son Raya Malla (r. 1482-1519). It was originally intended as a rest house for Shiva ascetics. At some later date, probably during the reign of Vishva Malla (r. 1547-60) or Jitamitra Malla (r. 1663-96), the design was altered to change the sattal into that of a temple for worshipping Dattatreya. This required several architectural changes which fully manifested themselves over the course of four centuries.  First, and most importantly, the open-air layout of the sattal, derived from the Mandap, was bricked in and enclosed to form a distinct inner sanctum that was visually cut off from the outside world, corresponding to the central enclosed chamber common to Newari temples (i.e., the garbha-griha, or 'womb room'). Furthermore, the breezy porch wrapping around the building was infilled with wooden screens, creating a closed, covered ambulatory wrapping around the inner sanctum; again, mimicking the standard temple form. Thus, the building was converted into a more private, walled-off sanctuary befitting the deity housed within. The itinerant residents may have been offered alternate accommodations at the nearby Pujari Math compound, as suggested by a contemporary chronicle.  Secondly—and much later, in 1849—a two-story porch and cupola were added to the west side of the building over the front entrance, breaking the symmetry of the sattal form, which sTill manifested itself from the exterior. The addition of this porch was clearly not foreseen in the original design of the building. For instance, Slusser notes that the porch railings which run around the middle level of the building continue uninterrupted behind the rear of the cupola; the floors of the cupola and the room behind it are not even joined, although they appear so when viewed from the exterior. The ground floor, too, is architecturally distinct, as the bays of the porch are in the form of an open arcade, while the corresponding spaces behind it are wooden screens. Slusser suggests this may have been a clumsy attempt to recreate the mukhaMandap entry halls often found in Indian temple architecture; in Nepal, this form is largely unknown.  Nonetheless, Slusser notes that at the time of her writing in 1974 that a single yogi remained in residence at the temple, continuing its original function as a sattal in a most limited way.  Hutt notes that in the current era, although the temple is formally dedicated to Dattatreya, the Vishnu aspect of Dattatreya's divinity is dominant. For instance, Vishnu's conch and discus are mounted on pillars outside the entrance, and a gilded Garuda (Vishnu's vehicle) is mounted on a tall pole in front of the temple. A wooden figure of the     'Vishnu' Dattatreya peers down at the square from the cupola window over the porch, echoing a similar     peering down motif found at the Shiva-Parvati temple in Kathmandu."

      "Monument_Name": "Bhimsen temple",
      "Construction_Date": "1605 CE.",

      "Main_Deity": "Lord Bhimsen",
      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Bhimsen temple stands at the western side of Tachupal Tole (one of Bhaktapur's many public squares), opposite the far larger Dattatreya temple. It is dedicated to Bhimsen, the god of commerce in Nepal. Although situated in a prominent location, the temple's founding date and subsequent history are largely speculative and uncertain.Bhimsen is a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the shops. They believe that the praying of Lord Bhimsen would bring good fortune and success in business.  The structure is a long but narrow two-story building with an open-plan ground floor and a small enclosed room housing a staircase. The upstairs level houses a shrine to Bhimsen, whose statue overlooks the square when the shrine's interior shutters are open. Overhead, the roof is topped with a decorative cupola crowned with seven pinnacles. Directly adjacent to the temple, abutting the west side, is a large hiti (stepwell) that traditionally provided fresh water to local inhabitants.  Temples dedicated to Bhimsen are invariably rectangular, as are those to various other deities such as Bhairava. For Bhimsen, in particular, the shrine is always located on the upper level. Aside from this, the specific form of the structure may differ from site to site. In the view of this author, Bhaktapur's Bhimsen temple appears curiously like a sattal in design. Sattals are a specific form of dharmasala, or public rest house, which patrons built as a sort of public amenity and as an act of merit-making. They are usually built adjacent to a water source, including near hitis. Such     watering holes were natural focal points for villagers to gather and seek shelter from the hot sun or sudden downpours. According to Slusser, they might also be used for social gatherings, storytelling, or bhajana performances in honor of a particular deity. She also notes that many dharmasalas \"incorporate permanent shrines and thus perform a dual role, both shelter and temple\"   The distinction between sattal and temple is often hard to discern, and there are many instances of one becoming the other. For example, the Dattatreya temple on the other side of the square was probably itself originally built as a large sattal, but gradually evolved into a temple with the addition of various architectural changes over the course of centuries (reference the Dattatreya page for more details). The Bhimsen temple appears to remain closer to the archetypical sattal in appearance, greatly resembling the Sundhara-sattal in nearby Patan, among other buildings. However, it should be noted that the above is speculation on the part of this editor--as far as can be determined, none of the prominent historians of Nepalese architecture have authoritatively weighed in on the specific design and history of this temple.    The founding date of the temple is a matter of conjecture. Bhaktapur city's webpage suggests 1605, which would place it near the end of the reign of the long-lived Trailokya Malla (r. 1560-1613), but hedges that some sources date it to the 18th century. Its history only comes into sharp focus in 1853, as a painting by the amateur artist Henry Ambrose Oldfield depicts the temple and its surrounding environs, which have barely changed up unTil the present day. Oldfield's painting shows that even at that time, the elevated platform in front of the temple, housing a gilded lion statue atop a pedestal, was already in existence."

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Bhairavnath Temple stands on the east side of Bhaktapur's Taumadhi Square, southeast of the main Darbar square. Also known as the Kasi Biswonath or the Pantali mandir, it is a three-story, rectangular temple dedicated to the god Bhairav (Nasa Dyo), an incarnation of Shiva and the god of terror and infinite space. More specifically, according to Dowman, this particular temple is the residence of Akash Bhairav (the sky Bhairav) and is distinguishable from other manifestations of the same deity, such as the Akash Bhairav in Kathmandu.Bhairav has a particular fascination with machines and is often thought to inhabit wheels, with different versions of the god inhabiting different wheels on the same chariot. At the Bhairavnath temple, a chariot used in the annual Bisket-Jatra festival is stored, dismantled, against the temple's north wall. Around the Nepali new year per the Vikram Savat calendar—in March or April—the chariot is reassembled, and an image of Bhairav is installed within the chariot. Although the chariot, like the temple, is huge, the image of the god is a diminutive 30-centimeter head lacking a body. At festival time, competing teams from the town's upper quarter (the thane) and the lower quarter (the kvane) meet in the large Taumadi square in front of the temple. According to Gutschow, the square is a sort of neutral zone where the opposing teams compete in a grand tug-of-war contest to pull the chariot toward one or the other sides of town. As the chariot is tugged in opposite directions, it advances slowly along the streets according to whichever team is strongest. In the end, regardless of whichever side 'wins' the chariot is ultimately moved to the Yahsikhyah square on the south side of the city in time for New Year's Eve.  The depiction of Bhairav as a beheaded entity is not without precedent, though the particular circumstances of his beheading are unique to this mandir. According to legend, long ago, Kasi Bhairabnath (or Vishvanath, another name for Shiva) traveled to Nepal to view either the Bisket Jatra (per Hutt) or the Bal Kaumari Jatra (per Dowman). A tantric priestess in the crowd recognized him for what he was and attempted to immobilize him, but Vishvanath sought to escape by sinking into the ground. As his body descended into the earth, the priestess realized the god was her own husband. To prevent his escape, she ordered his head cut off where it protruded from the ground. Being a god, this was far from a fatal wound, and the priestess enshrined the head in the temple that now stands here. The body, meanwhile, returned to Benares whence it came. Dowman notes that a headless image of Bhairav is sTill worshipped there even today.  The temple was first built during the reign of King Jagat jyoti Malla (r. 1614-37) as a much smaller one-story structure. The second tier was added by Bhupatindra Malla in 1717. The final tier was added either by Malla or was constructed following the devastating earthquake of 1934, which resulted in the temple's collapse and reconstruction. Despite the temple's recent age, or perhaps because of it, the building was not significantly affected by the April 2015 earthquake, apart from the collapse of the adjacent Betal Temple (to the south), which has yet to be reconstructed as of late 2020.  Curiously, there is no entrance on the temple's lengthy west facade that faces the square. Instead, priests access the interior from the south. The west facade is largely symmetrical and features a ground-level shrine with Bhairav depicted in miniature on a small metal throne. Michael Hutt notes that this small statue is frequently stolen and replaced. To either side of the deity are hammered copper plates depicting Bhairav's eyes, two pairs of hands, and two dogs—Bhairav's mounts and his faithful companions. At present, perhaps to discourage theft, the ground-level shrine is blocked from casual access by a makeshift wooden barricade. Also stolen (but not replaced) are several images that once graced the torana above the shrine, depicting Bhairav flanked by Ganesh and Kumar.   Above the statue and to the right is a straw mat painted with another representation of Bhairav in the form of Akash Bhairav (the god of the sky). This deity has taken to the air in the modern age—his face is prominently displayed on aircraft operated by Nepal Airlines.  "

          "The Nyatapola Temple stands at the north end of Bhaktapur's Taumadhi Square. It is one of only two five-tiered pagodas in the whole of the Kathmandu Valley, the other being Kumbheshwar Temple in Lalitpur / Patan. The temple's sanctum enshrines Bhagawati in her specific incarnation as Taleju, a deity worshipped by the Malla kings as a protectress of the kingdom. However, the precise name of the Taleju deity worshipped here is not known with any certainty, as the temple's priests (Rajopadhyaya Bramins) conduct their sacred Tantric rites with the utmost secrecy. For this reason, the temple is not particularly important in the religious fabric of Bhaktapur, even though it (quite literally) towers over every other temple in the region.  The name of the temple    'Nyatapola'  means     'five roofs' as the usual practice of naming the temple after its enshrined god or goddess is not possible here, given the temple's extraordinary secrecy. Writing in     Nepal Bernier notes that     Its five roofs appear so stable in their rise to the great height of the pinnacle that one expects them to last forever and indeed the 1934 earthquake which leveled so many temples collapsed only the uppermost roof of Nyatapola  (Bernier, p. 103). Bernier's words proved prescient, as the temple survived the devastating April 2015 earthquake, though renovations extending into 2020 were needed to ensure the long-term stability of the structure.  The origins of the temple date to the reign of the prolific builder, King Bhupatindra Malla (r. 1696-1722). At the dawn of the 18th century, the Taumadhi square was already bordered by the rectangular Bhairavnath temple to the southeast, enshrining Akash Bhairab, the god of terror and infinite space. Oral traditions credit that the King grew concerned by reports that Akash Bhairab was angry, causing all manner of troubles. He—or his advisors—felt that the construction of a temple dedicated to a female deity would counterbalance the heavy male presence of Bhairab. Hence, the King ordered a grand temple devoted to a Tantric goddess, either Taleju or Siddhi Laksmi.    The foundation of such a large temple had to be especially strong; hence, the five-tiered, pyramid-like base acts as a firm anchor for the towering structure. Engineering solutions alone were only part of the strategy for ensuring the tower's long-term survival; the King also relied on supernatural assistance. His artisans fashioned a grand south-facing stairway flanked with five pairs of animals and gods. Legend asserts that the power of each set of statues increases by a factor of 10 with each tier. Hence, the topmost deities (usually identified as Simhini and Vyangini—normally, minor deities) are said to be 10,000 times stronger than the lowermost pair, the likenesses of Jai Mal and Patta, two of Bhaktapur's most famous wrestlers. The implication is that the innermost deity—the female entity enshrined within, whoever she may be—is ten times more powerful sTill. Here strength is sufficient to ensure Akash Bhairab's peace and the city's tranquility.  Bhupatindra Malla's efforts ostensibly succeeded, but apparently, it was not the end of the matter for the young King, who continued his policy of appeasing Bhairab. Years later, in 1715, he ordered further renovations of the Bhairavnath temple, adding a second story (and possibly a third), making it more equal to the Nyatapola to the north.    The Nyatapola's subsequent history is not well documented (insofar as this author can determine) apart from reports of minor damage to the original structure in the 1934 earthquake. Following the next (and so far, last) large quake in April 2015, the temple remained standing but sustained structural damage to its uppermost levels. The Bhaktapur municipality refused offers of foreign assistance. Instead, it relied on local experts and resources in the repair effort, completing renovations by mid-2020, even amid the coronavirus lockdown.  The architectural historian Wolfgang Korn classifies the Nyatapola as a 'Type F' style temple, in which a colonnade wholly encloses an inner brick wall. In this regard, the temple is quite similar to others in the valley, such as the Uma Maheshwar of Kirtipur.  On the facade, the colonnade rests upon a scalloped     archway  that is given structural stability by a firm (~25 centimeter tall) wooden beam that rests upon it. Although difficult to discern today, the beam was once painted with images of flowers and plants. The beam's joints are hidden by small carved images of deities placed above the highest points of the     arches. Bernier notes that this whole ensemble is of an     unusual nature  (Bernier, p. 104). The cornice that stands atop this is carved with a wavy band, above which are projecting beam-ends carved in the likeness of pouncing tigers and other ferocious animals. Higher sTill, dental molding provides the uppermost base for the brickwork that supports the walls and brackets overhead.    A multitude of carved wooden brackets supports each tier of the roof. Generally, each comprises a three-dimensional carved image of a multi-armed deity standing above a lower register that depicts one or more other gods in various poses. Secondary brackets flank each primary bracket to provide added support. These are carved in the likeness of overlapping scalloped leaves resembling a snake's scales. It is clear that each composition was once brightly painted, but only faded remnants of the original coloring are discernable today.  The same format is used for each tier of the roofs, though the number of brackets decreases from six on a side (at the lowermost level) to two (on the top tier).    The roofs and brackets are supported structurally by a heavy brick core that diminishes in width the higher it rises above the plinth. At the base level, the brick core is decorated in typical Newar fashion with doorways that include a wide transom, quarter round panels on each side, and blind windows flanking the doors. There are no proper windows, and the doors are always kept locked to ensure secrecy. The interior space is likely only usable on the ground floor, meaning that whatever Tantric rites are held within the small, womb-like inner chamber, there is likely very little floor space and room for perhaps a dozen or so priests.

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Til Mahadev Narayan temple is a small two-storey Newari-style pagoda immediately to the south of the Taumaudi square. Although beautiful in its own right, it is frequently overshadowed by more prominent Nyatapola to the north and the Bhairavnath temple to the northeast. By contrast, the Til Mahadev is tucked away in a small square of its own hemmed in by modern buildings. Til Madhav Narayan is one of Lord Vishnu’s incarnations. Even if no one could enter the temple, the statue of Garuda, conch and wheel confirmed the presence of the deity. There is also Lord Natyeshwor, who is supposed to have been established there to protect Til Madhav Narayan.    According to Dowman, the temple is an    ancient site  as a mandir was established here as early as 1230. However, there is no indication that the present structure dates from that period, as the oldest wood and brick monument in the Kathmandu valley—the so-called Sulima Temple—dates to the 13th or 14th centuries. The age of the present Til Mahadev is unclear, but it would be surprising if it predates the Nyatapola (early 18th century) or the Bhairavnath (early 17th century) given the considerable construction that occurred in the vicinity in those periods.    According to Pratapaditya Pal, the word     Til Mahadev  is a reference to the word     Tila  meaning     Sesame seeds.    The temple was supposedly founded on Uttarayan Sankranti when a sesame merchant named Dharmadatta went to the     shrine of Marigalesvara and set up shop in front of the temple. As customers approached to buy seeds, an apparition of Vishnu, dressed in yellow clothing, emerged from the heap of sesame, holding a conch, discus, and mace. The amazed inhabitants established a temple to Narayan, an incarnation of Vishnu, in honor of the visitation. Pal also relates that the association of Vishnu with sesame seeds is of antique origin, as sesame seeds were thought to have originated from beads of Vishnu's sweat.    The temple may also have indirectly given rise to the name     Taumadhi  which is the overall designation of the great square at the heart of Bhaktapur immediately to the north. Beginning with the word     Til Mahadev the phrase was gradually corrupted to Tilam-de, then to Talamande, and finally to Taumadhi.    At present, the temple is notable for the hammered copper reliefs flanking the doorway and a large copper torana over the entrance. Dowman notes that the toran shows Shiva encircled by flame, standing atop the bull Nandi, with various other deities (including Garuda and Brahma) surrounding him. Inside the temple, the main image is of Narayan beneath a stone torana. Unfortunately, however, photography within the temple is not permitted, as is often the case.    In front of the temple are several pillars showing Garuda, a conch, and a discus, each closely associated with Narayan.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Phasi Degaḥ is raised on five levels of massive plinths similar to the Nyātapola Temple. It is the tallest śikhara Temple of the Kathmandu valley. The steps leading to the Temple’s sanctum are flanked by a pair of guardian stone elephants, lions and oxen. Although the plinths along with the mentioned guardian statues seem to have remained in their original shape, the Temple itself has undergone multiple renovations. Like many other temples at the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, no inscription records the initial construction of the Phasi Degaḥ. On the back of his painting of the Degaḥ, H.A. Oldfield has stated that it was built in 1650 CE. The painting shows the śikhara Temple of bricks, which is topped by a large golden finial. It appears in poor condition and the porches of the Temple had already collapsed. Most of the bajra plaster on the Temple had also come off while the plinths too were damaged at many places. It is unclear whether the structure of the Temple seen in Oldfield's painting was the original or was it only reconstructed in that style after it collapsed during the earthquakes of 1834 CE. All the medieval structures at the palace square boast of arts and craftsmanship. The architecture of the Phasi Degaḥ, however, does not possess such grandeur in comparison to the extensive plinth levels the Temple is built on. This allows us to suspect that the structure seen in Oldfield's painting was not the original structure of the Phasi Degaḥ.The photos of the Temple before the 1934 earthquake show it in a good shape with the porches also in place. This proves that the Temple was renovated at least once between the 1850s when Oldfield made his paintings and the early 1930s. It was rebuilt in the dome style after its collapse in the 1934 earthquakes. The name 'Phasi Degaḥ', lit. the pumpkin temple, probably came from the domed roof that looked like a pumpkin. The proper name of the Temple is Silu Mahādyaḥ. Silu is the Newar name for the Gosāĩkuṇḍa, a famous pilgrimage site in Rasuwa, Nepal. The Malla kings also used to make pilgrimage trips to Silu. Yakṣa Malla, Pārthivendra Malla, Mahīpatendra Malla, Bhāskara Malla, and other kings were known to have gone on pilgrimage to Silu (Ḍ Śarmā 1999, p. 269). This suggests that the Temple was made in the name of the holy site by a king or a member of the palace in the later medieval period. It is worth noting that temples were constructed at the palace square in the name of other such holy sites as well.    The Phasi Degaḥ suffered damages in the 2015 earthquakes. The Department of Archaeology started the reconstruction process to build the Temple in the śikhara style as it was before 1934 CE. The Temple was sTill in the process of reconstruction when this fieldwork was done in July 2021. The pre-1934 photos of the Degaḥ show that it had statues of the upper part of a lion a few metres above all four porches. Two of those statues were installed at a nearby building, west of the Temple while the other two were installed at the Gaḥhiti, stone water spout, in the Golamaḍhī Ṭola. The lion statues were probably left unattended after the collapse of the Temple in 1934 CE. Two of them were taken by Rāma Kaptāna, an influential person back then from Golamaḍhī, and installed at his locality (S. Śreṣṭha VS 2078). All four statues of lions were intended to be installed in the Temple at their original place. However, the locals from Golamaḍhī Ṭola protested against the idea and were adamant about not allowing the statues to be taken away from the water spout. The reconstruction, therefore, continued with only two statues of lions installed at the Temple.    There is no guthi related to the Phasi Degaḥ in existence at present. It was a regular practice to form a guthi by donating lands to perform daily rituals and to provide care for the monument after its construction. The Phasi Degaḥ must also have had plenty of plots of land to run the Temple, as it stands at the palace square. Locals do not know about any guthis and income of the Temple. A śivaliṅga on a large stone plinth is enshrined at the sanctum of the Phasi Degaḥ. Unfortunately, the Temple usually remains closed throughout the year, as all traditions of daily and other rituals have been discontinued (local knowledge, local resident, Śarmā, male, age 69)."

          "Siddhi Lakshmi Temple is one of three shikara-style temples built in Bhaktapur square, and one of only two surviving examples (the third, the SiluMahadeva, was destroyed in the 1934 earthquake, while the second, the Vatsala Devi, sTill stands). It honors Siddhi Lakshmi, a patron deity of the Malla Kings. The goddess was believed to have the power to drive away evil spirits and negative forces, and in this sense, served as a protector. As she represents one of the manifestations of the wrathful goddess Durga, various bas-reliefs of Durga are mounted above the temple's entrance and on its sides.The temple is located immediately to the southeast of the so-called 55-Window Palace. It stands upon a seven-tier diminishing plinth, shaped like a low stepped pyramid. Entry is from the south side, with the path up the plinth lined with 10 superb sculptures of humans, animals (horses, dogs, rhinos), and various fanatical animals (mythical figures and sloth bears). Van der Geer notes that The rhinoceroses are chained, but whether that is proof of any kind of use, be it in war or to plow the fields, is very uncertain (Van der Geer, p. 385). This motif—a pathway lined with animals and human figures—is unusual in the valley apart from sites in Bhaktapur. Hutt notes that Slusser suggests [this] may reflect a measure of Chinese influence (Hutt, p. 127). Hutt further notes that Bhaktapur is the last major Newar town on the old land route to Beijing, though that does not definitively settle whether     Chinese influence is actually expressed here.    The temple was substantially damaged in the 2015 earthquake but remained standing in a precarious condition. Temporary wooden scaffolding was employed to reinforce the structure, which was in imminent danger of collapse. The conservators dismantled the temple—stone by stone—and rebuilt it to stabilize stones that had shifted and added seismic reinforcement. The project cost roughly 140K USD. After the reconstruction was completed, the image of the deity was moved back into its original position within the temple's inner sanctum.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Vatsala Durga (also known as the Vatsala Devi) is located on the east side of the Bhaktapur Darbar Square, sandwiched between the Pashupatinath temple to the south and the Fifty-Five Windows wing of the palace to the north. It is a sikhara-style monument dedicated to the Vatsala manifestation of the female deity Durga.   The temple was the third Vatsala temple constructed in Bhaktapur's Darbar Square, following two earlier temples constructed by King Jitamitra Malla (r. 1663-96). The first temple is a miniature shrine located behind the Pashupatinath temple; the second was constructed behind the Siddhi Lakshmi temple but was destroyed in the 1934 earthquake. The third temple, shown in this series of images, was likely built late in the 1690s, but the precise date is unknown. The only date that can be fixed is the replacement of the temple's bell in 1721, suggesting that the temple had already existed long enough for the original bell to require replacement. According to Basukala, Gutschow, and Kayastha, Vatsala was mentioned as the king's tutelary deity in an inscription on the first of the Vatsala temples. We may speculate that the same impetus drove Jitamitra Malla to construct the second temple and the young king Bhupatindra Malla (the son of Jitamitra Malla, r. 1696-1722) to build the third and final temple at the beginning of his reign.    The temple's subsequent history is largely unknown, apart from the dedication of a bell to Annapurna by Ranajit Malla, the son of Bhupatindra, in the early-mid 18th century. The structure survived intact unTil 1934, when it was partially destroyed in the great earthquake, which leveled numerous other Bhaktapur structures, many of which were not reconstructed. Although the Vatsala Durga was eventually rebuilt, it was destroyed anew in the April 2015 earthquake. Fortunately, it was painstakingly restored to a close approximation of its original condition, with work completed in early 2020.    Architecture	  As noted above, the monument is built in the sikhara style, which became popular in Nepal from the early 17th century onward. According to Hutt, the design may be based on the Krishna temple in Patan's (Lalitpur's) Darbar Square, built in 1637. As with the Siddhi Lakshmi and other monuments in Bhaktapur, the temple is constructed on a multi-tiered plinth with a staircase flanked by stone images of various animals—a motif common in Bhaktapur but not typical elsewhere in the Kathmandu valley.    The temple's body comprises a ground-floor sanctum girdled by an ambulatory with three bays on each side. Above this rises the tall, tapering shaft of the sikhara tower, constructed with rendented corners. Basukala et al. note that the shaft's ground plan is in the shape of a 20-corner mandala (vimsatikona). Surrounding the shaft are four octagonal corner towers and four rectangular porches at the cardinal directions. Inside the porches are depictions of Durga manifested as the Mahisasuramardini, the slayer of the buffalo-demon. More images of Durga in various Tantric expressions, numbering 32 in all (of which 27 survived before the 2015 earthquake), are inset within the corner octagonal pavilions' bays.    Further up the tower are statues of Bhairava at the corners, standing upon a throne of lotus leaves. Higher sTill are the forequarters of leaping lions (sardula), their paws extended forward into thin air--ready to pounce on any evil force threatening Durga's sanctuary. Directly above them on each face of the tower are small windows that serve no purpose but help venTilate the otherwise lightless and inaccessible interior of the sikhara, which was left empty to reduce its mass. Near the top of the tower, above the cornice, are stone images of the Eight Mother Goddesses. The top of the tower is a series of circular rings studded with multiple amalaka fruit bands, ending in a finial in the shape of a kalasa pot extruding a flame or jewel.    Back at ground level, the only accessible interior space of the temple is the central sanctum, a cramped chamber measuring 1.8 meters on a side, topped with a 2.8-meter high dome. In contrast to the exterior, the space is sparsely furnished apart from the altar to Durga, which is inscribed with complex iconography. Durga herself is represented not in human form but in the guise of a kalasa pot (a symbol of fecundity and renewal) sprouting an abundance of leaves, topped by a sriyantra motif resembling a Star of David. The use of kalasa pots as an auspicious motif is common throughout Indianized areas, including regions as far afield as Bagan, Myanmar where it may be found on temples such as the 11th century Nan-hpaya."

Despite the fact that it is only a pavilion, it is one of the most stunning constructions of the Malla era. The kings of Bhaktapur, however, were not responsible for its construction.   The entire credit goes to King Srinivas Malla, the then-King of Lalitpur who erected it as a sign of friendship.  Aside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chayasilin Mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live-in front of the glorious deity.  And living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chayasilin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.  This venue once was also a popular choice for the poetry contest. According to published knowledge, King Bhupatindra Malla and his consort once held a poetry competition at this spot.  This pavilion was also used to welcome royal guests, observe festivals, and enjoy the breathtaking sunset views.  Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 A.D. and lost its original form. Later, in 1992 A.D., the German architects graciously reinstall this covering at its original speed. They used steel and the ruins of the old Chayasilin Mandap there. As a result, it was completely impervious to the April 2015 earthquake.  "

The present temple is the product of Bhupatindra Malla (r. 1696-1722), who also commissioned the so-called Fifty-Five Windows Palace, a wing of the larger royal compound north of the square.  The Gopinath is one of four tirthas collectively known as the Char Dham or     Four Abodes  intended to substitute for distant pilgrimage sites. These stand-ins represent the following locations, all of which were broadly inaccessible to 17th-century Nepalis, as each lay at one of the four corners of India:  The Jagannath temple of Puri, in southeast India.  The Rameswaram temple in Tamil Nadu, in the deep south.  The Dwarka temple in Gujarat, in western India.  The Badrinath temple in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, in northern India.  Bhupatindra Malla's solution was to place all four of the substitute sites together in one area of the square so that they might all be visited in a matter of minutes. The practice of     substituting  a holy pilgrimage site for another is not unusual; for example, in Kathmandu, the Kathesimbhu stupa is a stand-in for the Swayambunath. Although located mere kilometers from one another, the Swayambunath was difficult for the old, infirm, and sick to reach as it stands atop a high hill. A similar tradition also exists in nearby Bhutan. To give one of many examples, the Nalanda Buddhist Institute was established in the 1750s so that pilgrims need not make the arduous journey to the original Nalanda some 800 kilometers to the south.  Somewhat confusingly, the Gopinath Krishna is known by a variety of names.

Michael Hutt, writing in     Nepal: A Guide to the Art and Architecture of the Kathmandu Valley instead gives the name Bansi Narayan, assigning the name Badrinath to another of the four tirthas. By contrast, the architectural historian Niels Gutschow labels the site as the Gopala of Dvarikanatha, noting that it is dedicated to Krishna.

For the reason of having an image of a pair of stone lions.King Bhupatindra Malla erected it in 1698 A.D. Also, picturesque it as Malatichwok. But locals prefer to call it Simhadhwoka layaku rather than Malatichwok. Later, in 1960, the Government of Nepal and the Department of Archaeology set it up as the National Art Gallery.   The National Art Museum was inaugurated by Bishwesvar Prasad Koirala. He was Nepali Congress Supreme and the very first elected prime minister of Nepal.  Consequently, this museum is the best among the three museums of Bhaktapur. You can easily find this place, once you enter the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The two stone images of lions pleasantly embrace you. Along with that, another stone sculpture of Hanumanta-Bhairav and Nar-Shima also shows you the way toward the museum.  Notwithstanding, this museum has a small acquisition. But, it has a good collection of manuscripts and chronicles, which date back to the 11th century. Similarly, it is the home of ancient Paubha Scroll paintings, tantric cloth paintings. Also, the artefacts of bronze, brass, stone, and wooden images.    This architecture is not in its fundamental shape after the devastating earthquake of 1934 A.D. Yet, was also harmed in the quake of 2015. But it is protecting a lot of unique discoveries in it. That includes the stone varieties on its ground floor.    The ground floor of the National Art Museum  As you enter the National Art Museum, you would find a counter where you have to pay and take the tickets. Advantageously, you won’t need to buy tickets for another two museums of Bhaktapur (Wood carving museum and the brass and bronze museum), once you buy one over there.    The tour of the Museum starts with the masks of Nava Durga, the most prestigious deities of the Bhaktapur, and the statue of four-handed Ganesha. Along with that, you can notice some stone inscriptions on your right-hand side.    The next room separated by a door somehow offers you more than the old inscriptions and masks. You would encounter the four-faced shivaling and other reverse statues of Surya, Kubera, Vishnu, Ardhanareshwor, Tara, Laxmi Narayan, and many more.    With that, this floor displays the most erotic paintings of god and goddess, specially dedicated to the Bhairava and his shakti. The description regarding those paintings says that the Bhairava over here is shown in an extensive system of yogic union with his shakti, Bhairavi.    Simply looking at these paintings, one can see them engaging in sexual posture but the philosophy of such posture is quite different from what one sees through eyes. Those postures depict the tangible expression of the metaphysical concept that salvation results from the yogic union of the male and female organs.    However, there is one more image consisting of Mahasambhara that portrays the Mahasambhara, one of the popular deities of the Vajrayana cult of Buddhism in his extensive system of Yogic union with his shakti, Bajrabarahi.  The first floor of the National Art Museum  The very first floor of the National Art Museum is filled with paintings of different eras. And, it has an all-embracing paintings collection of airbrushing Vasundhara, Ganesh Shakti, Mahisa Sambhara, Vajra Yogini, Asta Bhairava with their shakti, and Shiva. It also has the classic paintings of Krishna Leela and Madhukaitavabadha.    The images of various kings and princes after King Prithi Narayan Shah are also depicted over there. The very first thing that you would notice over there is those immense memories of the kings.    Furthermore, the stage has centuries-old written inscriptions which apparently make us wonder and think about the inventions of that era. On top of that, the handwriting is super good.  "

          "The so-called  Palace of Fifty - Five Windows  is located on the north side of Bhaktapur's Darbar square and comprises the Tripura palace's southeast wing. While the palace as a whole was founded in the mid-12th century during the reign of Anandadeva I, the fifty-five windows wing was begun much later, in 1697, during the reign of Bhupatindra Malla (r. 1696-1722). It is a three-story structure with two brickwork levels interspersed with a rhythmic series of alternating doors and windows. The upper level is constructed as a continuous balcony of fifty-five windows with latticed screens, colonettes, and trilobate arches—all made of wood, generally pine, sal, or teak—that combine to produce a thickly-layered, three-dimensional surface that commands the eye.At the time of its construction, glass was in such short supply that only one of the windows was originally glazed using glass plating produced in India. Galdieri et al. note that in an inscription known as the 826 Jyestha krsna 4-5 satahhisa naksatra ayusmana yage budhavara, the chronicler records the following observations of the palace:    It has fifty-five windows, in one of which there is a small pane of glass, presented to him by a man from the plains of India. This piece of glass was considered so rare and valuable that the Raja placed it in the window as an object of wonder for the people. (Translation by Galdieri et. all, p. 552).    This glass window no longer exists; its fate is unknown, though it may have fallen victim to one of the many earthquakes that frequently plague the area, one of which (in 1934) resulted in the destruction of the upper levels, which were subsequently rebuilt. Shrestha notes that as mostly salvaged materials were used in the reconstruction, many of which were broken, a decision must have been made to reduce the depth of the balconies by trimming the broken joists' edges, thereby shortening them. Hence, the present palace balconies are less than half the depth of the originals, with the upshot that they comprise mostly original components.  In plan, the overall building is U-shaped, with the mouth of the     U  facing north, framing one of the six chowk, or courtyards, that are interspersed throughout the palace. Although only six such courtyards remain at present, at least twelve sTill existed as late as 1742. According to tradition, the palace held no fewer than 99 chowks at one point, but it is difficult to see that figure as anything other than an exaggeration.    Off-limits to the public (unTil recently) are a series of mural paintings lining the middle level's outer wall, painted in a style that Hutt refers to as     Rajasthani . These primarily depict the eighth avatar of Vishnu, who is rendered in a conspicuous bluish color. Galdieri et al. suggest that these mural paintings likely date to the beginning of the 18th century. More recent research concluded that the murals also depict the king and the queen's self-portraits, with the central figure dedicated to Shiva Vishvarupa (the universal form of Shiva). Such depictions are rare in both Nepali and wider art, as usually Vishnu is presented in this form.    Although the murals were partially restored in the 1980s, they were irreparably damaged over the centuries by water infiltration and, more recently, by the use of the building as a military office into the 1950s.    In the 2000s, much of the structure was carefully disassembled (brick by brick) and then reconstructed using the original materials whenever possible. This repaired centuries of damage inflicted by earthquakes, water damage, and weathering and likely greatly contributed to its survival in the disastrous earthquake of April 2015.  "

          "Viśveśvara temple is located in front of the Maṇi Hiṭī, to the west of the main street of the Patan Darbar Square and to the north of the famous Kṛishṇa Temple. The colonnaded temple's main structural columns stand on the periphery of the top plinth, and a toraṇa thā̃ supports the arched tympanum. 20 stone bases have been intricately carved in the forms of lions and serve to hold up the timber posts. The stone panels in between the stone bases feature images of celestial spirits and different plant symbols and foliage. The overhanging pitched roof is covered with jhĩgaṭī tiles and supported by beautifully carved struts that display images of different deities. The finial of the temple is a brass pinnacle. A trident (triśūla) has been installed alongside the pinnacle and resembles the weapon of Lord Śiva.  The two-tiered temple is based on three plinths, consisting of two high base plinths and a top plinth with an ambulatory path. The temple can be accessed from two directions; the east side is furnished with a series of steps flanked by two stone statues of the royal family riding on elephants, whilst the western side is marked by a stone nandī. The western side is also guarded by two stone lions and flanked by images of Yama and Kubera. The doors, columns and toraṇas of the temple exhibit excellent wood-carvings. All the doors, and even the bays over the columns, have intricately carved toraṇas.      The main sanctum is surrounded by a colonnaded structure with five bays. A stone śivaliṅga can be found at the center of the sanctum, and is furnished with four intricately carved doors facing in all four directions. Stone images of Viṣṇu (north-east), Umāmaheśvara (north-east), Sūrya (south-east), Bhairava (south-east), a Yogin (south-west), Gaṇeśa (south-west), Mahālakṣmī (north-west) and Annapūrṇā (north-west) have been attached to the exterior wall of the first floor. Images of the Eight Dikpālas have been carved on the small wooden windows which flank each door. The struts of the temple contain images of a dancing Bhairava, Gaṇeśa, and Śiva with many faces and hands. The lower parts of the struts that support the lower roof of the temple also contain images; when these are combined with one another, they tell a story of someone showing various worlds to Śivaśarman. At the bottom of each of the struts, one can find inscriptions that act as the captions of each specific image.    This temple was constructed by King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla in 1627 CE. Vajrācārya (VS 2056, 69) surmises that this was the first temple the King had built. The stone inscription placed at the plinth of the temple informs its readers that the King also made a golden spout to the west of the temple. However, the spout can no longer be located.    The upper roof of the temple collapsed in 1989 and was renovated by UNESCO in 1990. The temple was severely damaged during the 2015 earthquake. It was recently (2019) renovated by the KVPT. No guṭhī related to this temple could be found; it seems that none exists at this time.  "

          "Bhīmasena Temple, built by Siddhinarasiṃha Malla, is one of four major Bhīmasena temples in Lalitpur. It is located at the northern end of Patan Darbar Square. The three-tiered temple is built on a single plinth measuring 10.50 m x 8.2 m, with the wider side facing to the east. This side is also the principal façade, the main entrance of which is guarded by two stone lions. A narrow street runs to the north of the temple and leads to Patkva Ṭola.  A three-bayed colonnaded structure can be found at the rear wall, facing west, as well as a door. A small room at the north east corner can be accessed from inside as well as from the front. A single run stone staircase is located on the southern wall, and ascends in an easterly direction towards the room where the main image of Bhīmasena is installed. Another flight of stairs can be found at the south west corner.   The principal façade of the first floor has a projecting canted bay window clad in intricate carving works. The artistically carved struts display images of different deities and support the broad overhanging roofs. The two lower roofs are covered with jhĩgaṭī tiles while the top roof is clad with brass roof. This appears to have been a later addition; originally, the temple had a jhĩgaṭī roof as seen in photographs by Bourne & Shepherd taken around 1870. There are a cluster of pinnacles on each front roof; these are attached to the main core wall. The topmost pinnacle at the highest ridge of the temple is highlighted by its crowning umbrella.    Four Bhīmasenas are considered to be the major Bhīmasena Temples of Lalitpur, namely, Juju Bhindyaḥ (the King's Bhīmasena) of Mangalbazar, Puṃ Bhindyaḥ (the artists' Bhīmasena) of Sundhara, Dhvākhā Bhindyaḥ (a Bhīmasena placed near a door) of Chāḥbahāla and Kumhāḥ Bhindyaḥ (a Bhīmasena established by potters) of Cyāsal. Bhīmasena is a mythological character of Hindu mythology and is worshipped as the god of trade in Newar society. This temple is considered to be one of the eight jewels of the Patan Darbar square.    A wooden toraṇa is fixed above the main door to the temple, though its central image has been lost. To the south of the entrance, one can find a hanging bell donated in NS 817, as well as an inscription dated NS 801. The inscription informs readers of the reconstruction of the temple. Another bell hangs to the north of the entrance; this was donated in NS 817. A narrow stone stair on the southern wall leads upstairs, where an image of Bhīmasena has been installed in the sanctum. The bronze image depicts Bhīmasena killing Duḥśāsana. Near this image, one can also find images of a yellow Draupadī, a blue Bhairava and a red Kālī. In addition to the sanctum, there is also a secret room in the first floor. The image of Bhīmasena that has been placed in this room is only taken out on the day of the Bhīmasena procession. This floor also contains a window with a balcony that is clad in gilded metal. The roofs of the temple are supported by struts with the images of Bhairava, Gaṇeśa, Bhīmasena and other gods. These were donated by various donors between NS 802-803. Remnants of the original clay image of Bhīmasena can be found on the second floor of the temple; this older image was replaced by the present image. The temple is topped with gilded finials, and the middle finial is topped with a parasol. A metal banner (patāḥ) hangs down from the central pinnacle.    No historical document recording the initial construction of this temple could be found. The temple was reconstructed in NS 747 by Siddhinarasiṃha Malla. Kīrtipatākā (in 79-80 verses), a poem composed by Kunu Śarmā in NS 772, mentions this temple and explains that the merchants became prosperous thanks to Bhīmasena, who killed Kīcaka and defeated Kauravas in the Mahābhārata war. The structure of this monument has changed over time. According to the post colophon of Dānaratnākara, the temple originally had just one storey. During the reconstruction process, Śrīnivāsa Malla apparently added two more storeys in NS 801 (Regmi 1960, 287). The monument was once a capāḥ, and was known as Balaṣūni Capāḍa. Some time later, Yoganarendra Malla replaced the previously enshrined clay image of Bhīmasena with a bronze one, and began the procession of Bhīmasena. According to legends, Kalyāṇa Siṃha of Naudvã Bāhāḥ sculpted this image whilst trying to depict the furious face of Yoganarendra Malla.    The temple was not destroyed in the 1934 earthquake, but suffered considerable damage as a result of the 2015 earthquake. It is currently under renovation (2019). The sanctum is not accessible due to this reconstruction work. A small replica of the main image has therefore been placed on the ground floor so that regular worship may continue.    "

          "Cāra Nārāyaṇa Mandira is the oldest temple in Patan Darbar Square. It is a copy of the Cāra Nārāyaṇa Temple (a.k.a. Jagannātha) in Kathmandu. Cāra Nārāyaṇa Mandira is located at Patan Darbar Square between Kṛṣṇa Mandira and Nārāyaṇa Mandira. This two-tiered temple is built on a double plinth and faces east, towards the Royal Palace. The temple has a famous alley that leads to the west; this is known as Mvaḥ Maru Galli.    The temple is attached to a wide platform to the east which is known as Kārtik Dabu. It can be accessed by climbing a flight of stairs guarded by two stone lions. The top plinth once housed two stone images of Jaya and Vijaya, who also guarded the carved main entry door (Bernier 1978, 66). However, these images have now been placed inside the Keśavanārāyaṇa courtyard. The door is built as a tripartite portal. It is based on a stone threshold, and each wall contains such doors, all of which are flanked by two aedicules on either side. Each of these doors is surmounted by tympanums carved with various deities. The main door's torana shows Naṭarāja dancing on top of the seven heads of a nāga (Jośī 2065, 44). Eight Dikpālas have been placed on the small niches made on the walls of the outer wall. Agni and Indra are located to the east, Niṛti and Yama are to the south, Vāyu and Varuṇa are on the western wall, and Īśāna and Kubera are to the north.    The floors are separated by bands of carved timber cornices. The first floor has three small beautifully carved windows on each of its four walls. The overhanging first roof is supported by slanting struts that display wonderfully carved images of different forms of Vaishnava. Out of the 24 incarnations of Viṣṇu, 20 various forms have been depicted on the struts which have been supporting the lower roof. Besides these images one can also spot images of lions in erotic actions and men helping them (Jośī 2065, 44). Such images are uncommon in Vaishnava temples. Gutschow (2011, vol. II, 395) suggests that these struts were probably added at a later date. The top floor has a central window flanked with two aedicules, one on each side. The upper roof is also supported by carved struts showing images of female deities, the consorts of Viṣṇu in his various incarnations. The roofs were covered with traditional j­­­hĩgaṭī tiles. The pinnacle had a gilded finial and a single layer of āmalaka.    A circumambulatory passage inside the exterior wall leads around the main sanctum, in which a stone image of Cāra Nārāyaṇa is enshrined on a pedestal. Four Vyūhas of Nārāyaṇa, namely Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha have been placed respectively at the east, south, west and north sides of the sanctum. The essence of these gods, Nārāyaṇa, the eternal Braman who appears as the whole universe, is in the middle. The four faces of the Caturvyūha symbolise different creatures and powers. Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the symbols of human, lion, boar and a terrifying face respectively, and they in turn represent strength, knowledge, prosperity and power. Vāsudeva is holding a conch, a wheel, a club and a lotus in his four hands. Similarly, Saṅkarṣaṇa is holding a plough, a pestle, a lotus and a conch. Pradyumna is holding a bow, an arrow, a conch and a lotus. Aniruddha is holding a shield, a sword, a lotus and a conch. Devotees believe that visiting Cāra Nārāyaṇa will fulfil their desires and make them prosperous and healthy. Four manifestations (vyūha) of Lord Viṣṇu have been incorporated in one stone statue of the sanctum of the temple, giving the temple the name Cāra Nārāyaṇa.    This is the oldest temple in the Square (Pruscha 2015, 164). There are four other famous Nārāyaṇa temples in the valley: Icaṅgu, Viśaṅkhu, Śeṣa and Cā̃gu. It is believed that this temple represents these four famous Nārāyaṇa temples.    This temple collapsed completely in the 2015 earthquake and is under reconstruction as of 2019.    Purandara Siṃha, a Mahāpātra of Lalitpur made a donation for the initial construction of this temple in 1566 (see the inscription from NS 686 below) in memory of his father, Viṣṇu Siṃha. Viṣṇu Siṃha took power in 1546 (cf. Gutschow 2011, vol. II, 420 and Gutschow 2016, 101). He was a Mahāpātra, but he declared himself to be the King of Lalitpur when the centre lost its control. Later, Viṣṇu Siṃha’s three sons Nara Siṃha Deva, Purandara Siṃha Deva and Uddhava Siṃha Deva jointly ruled Lalitpur until 1597, when Śiva Siṃha Deva took Patan back from the local dynasty and restored it to Malla rule (cf. Gurschow 2016, 101). The chronicles do not accept these Mahāpātras as kings. The Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī (19.2.88) mentions that Purandara Rājavaṃśī built the temple of Nārāyaṇa in front of the palace in Lalitpur during the reigning period of King Mahendra Malla.  "

          "This temple is an exemplary combination of Vaishnavism and Shaivism. This three-tiered Hariśaṅkara Temple is situated between the Big Bell (LAL1250) and the Narasiṃha Temple (LAL1290). Many details of this temple have been designed following the standards set by the Viśveśvara Temple, which was the first temple of its type on Patan Darbar Square. The Hariśaṅkara Temple stands on top of three plinths and can be accessed from the east by climbing a three-levelled staircase inset into the plinths. Two guardian stone statues of elephants flank the first flight of stairs.    An east-facing stone statue of a standing Hariśaṅkara is enshrined in the sanctum. The right-half of the statue shows Śaṅkara, whilst the left half depicts Hari, so this temple is unique in that it combines Vaishnavism and Shaivism. Śaṅkara is holding a triśūla (trident), a ḍamaru, a japamālā (rosary) and a kamaṇḍalu (gourd) in his four hands, while Hari holds a śaṇkha (conch), a cakra (wheel), a gadā (club) and a padma (lotus). Śaṅkara's Pārvatī stands to his left, and Viṣṇu's consort Lakṣmī stands to the right. Both are made in the same stone.    The 24 struts of the lower roof exhibit both six- and eight-armed representations of Viśṇu, Gaṇeśa and Hanumān. An inscription at the bottom of these struts explains what will happen to evildoers when they arrive in hell (for an edition of these inscriptions, see Gail 1984: 74-76, and Gutschow 2019). For example, those who commit adultery will be fried in oil, while those who visit prostitutes will end up in hell. Representations of Śiva can be found in the 16 struts on the second roof and eight on the third roof.  The main structural columns of the colonnaded structure are on the periphery of the top plinth, and are decorated with a toraṇa thā̃ to support the tympanum. 20 stone bases have been intricately carved with the bodies of lions, and hold the timber posts which form the arcaded outer circumambulatory path. The stone panel between the base stones features celestial spirits holding shields and swords on a lotus throne. They are flanked by mythical birds with foliated tails.    No inscription could be found that recounts the initial construction of the temple. Based on the architectural similarities between this temple and the Viśveśvara Temple, it can be hypothesised that Hariśaṅkara Mandira was also built by Siddhinarasiṃha Malla around NS 747 (Śākya 2031, 14). However, the Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī (19.3.198) states that in NS 826 (1706 CE) Rudramatī Maiyā, a daughter of king Yoganarendra Malla, built a three-storied temple to the south of the pillar in her father's name. She established the deity Hariśaṅkara inside the temple. The Vaṃśāvalī mentions that Rudramatī was the daughter of Yoganarendra Malla, which seems to be incorrect; the inscription of Buṅmatī (dated NS 801) mentions Rudramatī as the daughter of Śrīnivāsa Malla (Vajrācārya 2056, 206-207). Similarly, another inscription of Kṛṣṇa Mandira, Saugala, Lalitpur dated NS 825 suggests that Rudramatī is the dauthter of Śrīnivāsa Malla and the elder sister of Yoganarendra Malla (Vajrācārya 2056, 346-348).

          "Taleju is the tutelary deity of the Malla kings of Kathmandu Valley. The temple in Patan was built by Siddhinarasiṃha Malla in 1620 CE. Taleju Temple is situated at the north east corner of the Mūla Coka, the major courtyard of Patan Darbar Square. Taleju Mandira is of a particularly unique design. Its three-tiered temple structure rises high above the north east corner of Mūla Coka, exhibiting a multi-tiered (pagoda) typology. The temple is supported by a monolithic base measuring approximately 600 cm (width) × 450 cm (depth) × 870 cm (height). The composition of this base has not been investigated, but it likely contains brick, mud and possibly stone. Taleju Mandira was almost certainly built at the same time as the Mūla Coka, as it is surrounded by and shares walls with the palace building. Mūla Coka was completed in the 1660s and Taleju Mandira in the 1670s (see Gutschow 2011, 319). Taleju is the tutelary deity of the Malla kings of Kathmandu Valley. She is also referred to as Tulajā, Bhavānī or Caṇḍikā. Legend tells that she originated from a tulā (scale) and this is why she is known as Tulajā (G. Vajrācārya 2033, 117). Taleju temples were established in the administrative centers of the Malla kingdoms. These temples can still be found in the Darbar squares of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur, as well as in Tokha, Madhyapur Thimi, Devapattana, Nuwakot, Dolakha, Banepa, Panauti, Chapagaun and Gokarna. Chronicles (Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī 18.55-70, Lamsāla 2023, 34) mention that King Harisiṃhadeva, a king of Simraunagadh, brought his lineage deity Taleju Bhavānī to Bhaktapur in NS 444 (CE 1324). The chronicle tells that the Goddess Tulajā told Harisiṃhadeva to bring her to Bhaktapur, because Mlecchas might attack in Simraunagadh. Heeding her warning, the King departed for Kathmandu Valley with his family the very next morning. However, it appears that this chronicle does not correspond with some of the historical facts. Historical evidence suggests that King Harisiṃhadeva never entered the Valley. In 1334, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, an emperor of Dehli, attacked Simraunagadh and King Harisiṃhadeva fled with his family. He arrived in Dolakha and died there in 1326 (VS 1382, 3rd of the bright half of Māgha) (Nepālī 2054, 1645).    Historians have varying opinions regarding the Goddess Tulajā. Some deny that King Harisiṃhadeva brought Tulajā from Simraunagadh, suggesting that the image of the deity installed by Licchavi King Vṛṣadeva was later gilded by Mānadeva I. Thereafter, the deity got the new name Māneśvarī. The same deity of King Jitāmitra Malla therefore received the new name Taleju (Naḥghaḥbhanī 2043, 14).    Although historians disagree on Harisiṃhadeva's arrival in the Valley, they do unanimously accept that the Taleju of Bhaktapur is the oldest of the three Talejus of the Valley. King Mahendra Malla built the Taleju Temple of Kathmandu in NS 684 (CE 1564) and Siddhinarasiṃha Malla established the Taleju Temple of Patan in 1620 (NS 740, 10th day of the bright half of the Jyeṣṭha). Siddhinarasiṃha made Lalitpur an independent country and installed the statue of Tulajā inside his palace after he appointed Viśvanāthopādhyāya as his guru (Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī 19.3.6; Yogī 2013, 56). During the installation, Taleju was first placed at the centre of the Mūla Coka, where the Śrī Yantāju can now be found. With the help of a fire alter at the north eastern corner of the courtyard, the Śrīyantra was infused with the life of the deity (source: the priest of the Taleju Temple). Śrīnivāsa Malla reconstructed the temple in 1671 (NS 791), and its structure has remained unchanged since then.    There are two Taleju shrines inside the Mūla Coka. The temple located at the north eastern corner of the courtyard is the most important of the two. The deity only spends four days (from the 7th to 10th day) in the southern shrine during the Dashain festival. As such, the shrine is called Daśaĩ Ghara (see LAL1260). She lives in the northern temple for the rest of the year. The entrance door to the temple is surmounted by a carved toraṇa and is located at the north-western corner of the courtyard. Mahiṣāsuramardinī stands at the centre of the toraṇa, flanked by Kumārī to her right and and Cāmuṇḍā to her left. The seven-storey temple has three octagonal roofs. The lower two roofs are tiled with jhĩgaṭī tiles while the upper one is covered in gilded metal. On top of the upper roo, a gilded Śikhara-styled temple structure serves as the finial of whole temple. Temples with a structure like this are called kalasa or saphu cakra devala (Tiwari 2003, 161). Vajrācārya (2033, 273) mentions that the height of the temple was 48.10 hāta, according to measurements made in 1830 (VS 1887, 7th day of the dark half of the Āśvina). The third floor is home to the sanctum where the main deity Taleju is enshrined. However, there are no images of the deity inside; a southfacing śrīyantra has been installed instead.  "

It was built by King Jayavishnu Malla and Queen Chandra Lakshmidevi and used for special proclamations by the Malla Kings. It is now rung during Khadgajatra in honour of the Goddess Taleju (Pruscha 1975, 162).  The Taleju Bell is located between the Hariśaṅkara Temple and Cyāsiṃ Devala in the Patan Darbar Square. Similar large bells also constructed during the Malla period can be found at Basantapur Darbar Square (Kathmandu) and the Bhaktapur Darbar Square.    This bell hangs on a stone beam supported by two stone pillars that are erected on top of a platform. To reach the platform, one must enter the inside of the plateau through a narrow door to the east of the building and climb up a ladder with 9 rungs. Above the beam, one can see a gilded copper roof, and on top of the roof there are three pinnacles topped with parasols. Small wind chimes hang down from the bottom of the roof, which in turn is supported by 16 struts. Statues of śārdūlas can be found on the struts positioned in the four corners, while other struts contain carvings of Gaṇeśa, Kumāra, Bhairava and Mātṛkās.    The body of the bell holds an inscription informing readers that it was commissioned by King Viṣṇu Malla (1729-1745) and Queen Candralakṣmī Devī. It also tells us that the work was supervised by general Mukunda Siṃha, and that this was paid for by the merchant Padma Siṃha. This inscription does not provide us any information about the intentions behind its construction. However, a Nepalese chronicle (see Bajracharya and Michaels 2016, 129) states that the King installed this bell to scare his enemies. It is said that in the Malla period, this bell was rung to let people know that a royal announcement was about to be made; upon hearing the noise, people nearby would gather near the palace. It may also have been rung to tell citizens to come together for other special occasions. There is also a legend that the bell was rung daily in the morning and evening when the palace worshipped Goddess Taleju. At present, the bell may be sounded only during special occasions in the Dashain festival (for example when the demon-dancers come to dance in Mul Chowk and sacrifice animals). Only then is the small gate to the bell's platform opened.    "

          "King Śrīnivāsa Malla rebuilt Mūla Coka in 1666 and it is clear that Taleju Mandira, a pagoda-style three-tiered temple resting atop the south wing was built as an afterthought, when Mūla Coka and Sundarī Coka were already established. As can be seen in the section drawing, the temple's southern half rests on the walls of Mūla Coka and Sundarī Coka whereas the northern half is supported by timber posts extending from the ground- and first floors of Mūla Coka. Taleju Mandira South features a śikhara temple-shaped finial topped with a parasol shaped after the famous Kṛṣṇa Degaḥ. During Viṣṇumalla's reign in the 1730s major renovations and the reshaping of the palace building were carried out. This included the installation of the Golden Door ensemble featuring life-sized statues of Gaṅgā and Yamunā and the donation of a gilt door and toraṇa.    The 1934 earthquake caused the temple's complete collapse and the ensuing reconstruction efforts resulted in a poor-quality reconstruction in which recycled materials were used. The roofs were rebuilt with inadequate timber and had a much-reduced overhang. They were further covered with corrugated steel sheets and pan tiles instead of traditional hand-made jhĩngaṭī tiles.    Between 2006 and 2012, the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust carried out a comprehensive restoration programme. Thanks to funding from a number of international organisations, the KVPT was able to restore the temple to its historic configuration. This included reconstructing the roof in its correct design and providing the temple with a roof cover using handmade terracotta (jhĩgaṭī) tiles.    The top tier of Taleju Mandira South collapsed in the 2015 earthquake and fell on to the roofs below, causing considerable damage to the temple structure and the palace roof. The reconstruction work done on the temple in 2016 and the recreation of the lost parts of the pinnacle is testament to the project's artistic excellence and clever use of innovative seismic strengthening techniques.    During the Daśaĩ festival a water vassel said to carry the essence of goddess Taleju is brought to this temple from the Taleju Mandira (LAL1270) and placed here for four days (from the 7th day to the 10th). On these days the door of Taleju Mandira South is open to the public. On the 9th day of Daśaĩ, Kumārī of Patan is brought here from Hakha Bāhāḥ (LAL0390). A buffalo is sacrificed and the meat is offered to Kumārī.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Krishna temple on the west side of Patan's Darbar square was completed in 1637. Legend says that it was inspired by a dream. One night, King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla (r. 1620-61) dreamt that the gods Krishna and Radha were standing in front of the palace. The King ordered a temple built on the same location. During a war with a neighboring kingdom a decade later, the King emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies. In gratitude, the King built a replica of the temple inside the Sundari Chauk courtyard. Krishna Mandir of Patan is perhaps Kathmandu Valley’s finest stone wrought monument. Krishna temple is made in the Shikhara architectural style, a style that is commonly found in what is now known as the Indian Subcontinent. Krishna Temple is 19.67 meters high. At its entrance is a statue of an eagle and a lion. There is a different reason behind building in Shikhar style.  Religious king Siddhi Narsingh used to perform Havan in the Yajna Kunda regularly. Even on the day he dreamed, the smoke that came out during the same havan took the shape of the present Krishna temple. It is believed that the temple was built in the Shikhar style on the same basis. The temple is made of stone, and the carving is finer than that of the other smaller Krishna Mandir at Patan Durbar Square, built by Yogamati, the great-granddaughter of Siddhi Narasimha Malla, in 1723. Beneath its 21 golden pinnacles are three floors. The first floor enshrines Krishna, the second Shiva, and the third Lokeshwor. Scenes from the Ramayana narrated in the Newari script decorate the temple’s interior. The 21 gajuras in the Krishna temple also have different meanings. During the regular havan of the king, 21 urns were installed. The name of the urn was also different. However, the name of the urn is not mentioned in the inscription on the temple. It is believed that 21 gajurs were made to represent the urn after the same urn was burnt in the yajna.  The first floor enshrines Krishna, the second Shiva (in the form of a linga), and the third Lokeshwor. On the way to the upper floor, you can see a statue of a lion called ‘Shardul’. Before ascending, Krishna can be seen playing the flute, Rukmini and Satyaga dancing.  Similarly, idols of Krishna, Rukmini and Satyagama, Garuda, etc. are kept in the sanctum sanctorum on the upper floor. The subject matter of the Mahabharata is briefly mentioned on the wall of the upper floor, just as the main point is mentioned. Also, idols of various forms of Lord Krishna can be seen.  The Indian style has more influence in the construction art of this temple. It took six and a half years to build this temple. This type of temple was built in South India from the 11th to the 13th century. It is also rare in itself as it takes a lot of capital to build such a temple. But in all the places where such temples have been built, such temples have been built for Lord Vishnu and his incarnation.    On the first floor of the temple, one can see the carved images depicting the events of the Mahabharat and the second floor has the carving depicting the Ramayana. It is said it took 7 years to construct the temple out of the different unusual items like legumes, sugar molasses, cotton, sawdust of Sal tree and vermilion powder, and stones. In front of this temple, there is the statue of Garuda, the mount of Vishnu, kneeling with folded arms atop of a pillar facing the temple, and on the back of the statue of Garuda is Kothihom Mandap. Non-Hindus are prohibited from entering the temple. Every year, a huge number of worshipers throng the temple during the festival of Krishna Janmashtami, Krishna’s birthday held in august/September (Bhadra).    Its architecture successfully blends two styles: the solidly formed Southern Gupta shikhara form and the open multi-storied style of Moghul.    The craftsmanship of the stone carvers can be seen in the intricate images of gods and the perforated stone screen railings of the passages. There is an open passage on the ground floor, and it is empty inside. A narrow and low passage leads to the center of the first floor.    The first floor is the main area of worship, where a large hall holds an image of Krishna with two consorts, Radha and Rukmini, all beautifully carved out of black stone. The flooring also contains images of the ten incarnations of Vishnu.The delicate stone carvings along the beam on the 1st-floor recount events from the Mahabharata. The second floor contains an image of Shiva. The hard-to-see beam on the 2nd floor features scenes from the epic Ramayana. The small fourth floor contains no images now; however, the people say that there was formerly a statue of Avalokitesvara. Perhaps such placement acted as an example of the harmonious blend of Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal.    It is assumed that Krishna is the incarnation of Vishnu. In the temple, there are pictures of Vishnu and Garuda, almost in every part of the temple. Even on the walls of the ground-level there are representations of the 10 avatars of Vishnu. Furthermore, a separate Garuda Statue is located in front of the temple and mounted on a pillar. It was built about ten years after the temple was built by King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla.    The steps to the temple’s first floor are narrow and small, and it is not common for the first-timers to hit their head while climbing down the stairs. From the balcony of the first floor, one could look around Durbar Square. The temple is adjacent to the Patan Museum because of which one can glance at the temple from the window of the museum. Viewing with a binocular from the museum window would give a clear view of the idols of Lord Krishna and his consorts enshrined in the temple.    The temple is usually opened at all times, and during the festival of Krishna Janmashtami, large numbers of devotees throng the square to offer worship to Lord Krishna. The temple is beautifully decorated with colorful papers, lights, and flowers during the festival. People gather around the 17th-century stone temple, which is beautifully decorated and lighted, singing praises of Lord Krishna waiting for the midnight hour. Euphoric prayers and chants fill the air, and small oil lamps are lit as a mark of felicitation and devotion to the deity.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Mani Mandapa ('Pavilion of Jewels') is a set of two pavilions flanking the entrance to the adjoining Mangahiti, a large stepwell located directly north of the Patan royal palace. Although built in different eras, the pavilions and waterworks functionally comprise a single unit, as the three structures each serve as public amenities. According to Katharina Weiler (writing in the KVPT source noted below), the stepwell originated during the Licchavi era in the 7th century. However, its present form likely dates to the 16th-17th centuries, the apogee of the Lalipur Kingdom's prosperity. Of the two pavilions on the west side of the stepwell, the south pavilion probably dates to the 16th century, while the north pavilion was present at least by 1701 when Yoga Narendra Malla (r. 1685-1705) renovated it, according to an inscription found on site. Both structures were altered over the course of the subsequent centuries, only to fall victim to thieves from the 1970s onward. At that time, many roof struts were stolen, likely bound for the illicit international art market. The pavilions were leveled by the April 2015 earthquake but were subsequently restored by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust using salvaged materials and new components carved in traditional fashion.    Purpose    The stepwell, known as the Mangahiti, was part of a much larger network known as the Raj Kulo (    Royal Channel) that diverted water from the periphery of the valley into a series of small neighborhood ponds known as pokhari, which in turn supplied numerous neighborhood hitis (step wells with spouts). In the environs of the Mangal palace, one such hiti terminated at the Bhandrakhal water tank, which was a private supply for the royal palace and the adjoining fountain in the Sundari Chowk (the so-called     King 's bath). The Mangahiti was, by contrast, a public amenity that city dwellers relied upon for their daily water needs. Even today, in an era when the Raj Kulo is beginning to fail due to population pressures, climate change, lack of maintenance, and falling groundwater reserves, the Mangahiti continues to provide fresh water that residents may collect in buckets to bring home as needed.    The adjacent Mani Mandapas are a form of dharmasala, or free public rest house, which wealthy patrons traditionally built as a form of public service to earn spiritual merit. As Slusser and Vajracarya observed, such pavilions run the gamut from simple rectangular patis to elaborately designed sattals (for example, the Sundhara sattal in Patan). The mandapa or madu is an intermediate form that is more substantial than a pati but does not include the living quarters often found in sattals.     In its capacity as a public rest house, the Mani Mandapas might serve as a temporary shelter from rain or the hot sun. Traditionally, they were also used for various state functions. In pre-modern times, the south mandapa served as a municipal weighing house where officials fixed the prices of goods sold in the marketplace. Newari priests and astrologers used the north pavilion to determine the most favorable dates for festivals. It also functioned as a coronation hall for Lalitpur's kings,    accounting    for the throne permanently mounted at its center.In this role,    it served more as a sabha,    which Slusser describes as an assembly hall and council chamber of the palace(Slusser p.217) a type of architecture idealized as a pillared hall— a perfect description of the Mani Mandapa.

          "The Patan Royal Palace Complex was constructed in the 17th century as part of the extensive building program of King Siddhinarasimha Malla, which was continued by his son Srinivasa. The Malla kings created their palace by enlarging and enhancing a group of buildings at an ancient crossroads in the center of Patan. The complex contains three courtyards, built at different times and each with its own character: Sudari Chowk (1647), Mul Chowk (1666), and Keshav Narayan Chowk (1734). The earliest of the three, Sundari Chowk is known for its spectacularly carved stone bath and wood ornamentation of animals and deities. The southern and northern wings were added in 1792 and 1820 respectively, demonstrating European influence with regular windows, shutters, a fireplace, and a grand reception hall on the upper level. The three pagoda temples and many shrines of Patan Royal Palace are still active today, including Degutale, a principal Tantric place of worship. Despite its continued use, the Patan Royal Palace was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage in Danger List in 2003 because of structural decay and the threat of urban development.  The Patan Museum that we know was once the ancient royal palace of the Malla Kings which now houses one of the finest collection of religious and historic art. South of the Patan Museum is the impressive Mul Chowk, the largest and oldest among the three main chowks which has the Biyapith Temple in the centre, Taleju Bhawani Temple on the south, Degutalle Temple on the northeast and Taleju Temple on the north. South of the Mul Chowk is the smaller Sundari Chowk, which has the magnificent Tusha Hiti, the royal bath. Likewise, Keshav Narayan Chowk, inside the Patan Museum to the north also houses the famed Keshav Narayan Temple at its centre. The view from the ancient royal palace of Patan looks on to the beautiful durbar square filled with multitude of temples and statues each displaying the peak of Newari architecture to be seen in Nepal.    The Patan Museum was inaugurated in 1997 by Late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah. The museum quadrangle, known as Keshav Narayan Chowk, takes its name from the temple in the center of the main courtyard and is best known for its beautiful facade framing the Golden door and window. This and two adjacent palace courtyards have it long and important history as a palace of the Malla kings of Patan.    The Patan Museum displays the traditional sacred arts of Nepal in an illustrious architectural setting. Its home is and old residential court of Patan Durbar, one of the royal palaces of former Malla Kings of the Kathmandu Valley. Its gilded door and window face one of the most beautiful squares in the world.    The Museum’s exhibits cover along span of Nepal’s cultural history and some rare objects are among its treasures. Their meaning and context within the living traditions of Himduism and Buddhism are explained. Most of the objects are cast bronzes and gilt copper repousse work, traditional crafts for which Patan is famous.  "

Like its counterpart to the north, the Krishna Mandir temple, it is built in the sikara style, imported from north India and Bengal. The word     Chyasim or    Chyasing  means eight-sided, in reference to its octagonal plan.

Singha Sattal, also known as Silyan Sattal is a 13th-century shelter located in the Kathmandu Durbar Square and It was built alongside the iconic Kasthamandap by King Lakshmi Narasimha Malla. The reign of Lakshminarasimha started when his grandfather Shivasimha Malla died in 1619. Kantipur had annexed Patan in the time of Shivasimha Malla but after his death, Siddhi Narasimha Malla declared Patan independent and hence Laxminarasimha only ruled the Kantipur.   Lakshminarasimha had a Kaji (minister) named Bhima Malla. Bhima Malla was sent to Tibet to negotiate a trade treaty. He succeeded in concluding a favourable treaty to Kantipur but after his return, other ministers conspired and accused him of trying to replace the King. The conspirators were successful, and Bhima Malla was sent to death.  The then tradition dictated that his wife be burnt along in her husband's pyre (Sati). It is said that she, about to be burnt, cursed the entire country. Due to that event, Nepal is also called Sati le sarapeko desh (land cursed by Sati).  Soon afterwards, the King realized his mistake of sentencing Bhima Malla to death. It greatly depressed him and later on he went insane. He was imprisoned by his son Pratap Malla under the grounds of insanity who ruled Kantipur until 1674.  "

In the very day of Indra Jatra, a wooden/ bamboo straw is placed in the mouth of the statue and rice liquor is siphoned as a prasad for the devotees. Swet Bhairav is alive with much festivity as local beer pours out from the mouth through a spout and the crowd of men competes to drink the holy beer. The alcohol if consumed is believed to bring good health and fortune via the blessings of Swet Bhairav.  On other days, people can peek through the latticed window, to get a glimpse of Swet Bhairav.

          "The Basantapur Tower is the tallest structure in Kathmandu's royal palace, the Hanuman Dhoka. Standing nine stories high, the building is variously referred to as the Nau Talle (Nine Storied) tower, the Basantapur Tower, or simply, Basantapur. It is one of four corner towers in what is described as either the Lvahancok Chok (courtyard) or the Basantapur Chok. Almost uniquely, these towers do not house any deities as they were constructed by Prithvi Narayan Shah (r. 1768-75) and Pratap Singh Shah (r. 1775-77) to symbolize the elder's unification of the valley. Thus, the four corner towers each represent a different sub-kingdom: Lalitpur (Patan) to the southeast, Bhaktapur to the northeast, Kirtipur to the northwest, and Basantapur (i.e., Kathmandu) to the southwest.  Background  Prithvi Narayan Shah is widely regarded as the first ruler of modern Nepal. Although born in Gorkha, far to the west of the valley, his armies successfully conquered state after state, marching into the Kathmandu Valley in September 1768. He instigated the tradition of using the Hanuman Dhoka palace as the seat of unified Nepal, ensuring lavish spending on its physical form during his reign and beyond. It remained the base of the Shah Kings through 1896. According to the architectural historian Michael Hutt, the early Shah kings made special efforts to patronize Newar arts and crafts. As a result, while the enormous height of structures such as the Basantapur tower was unusual, their layout and design were largely congruous with typical Newari monuments. Even the overall design of the Bastapur Chok, where the Shah rulers lived, was consistent with Newari precedent. Hutt notes that palace quadrangles in the chaukath style, with towers at each corner, are found as far back as the 12th century.  The Gorkhali-born Shahs were careful to patronize local traditions—at least in the early years of the dynasty—to minimize the perception that they were outsiders ruling over a captive population. Gutschow, another eminent architectural historian, notes that … [this] demonstrate[s] the initial ambition of the Saha[Shah] dynasty not to look    for North - Indian prototypes but to incorporate the architectural practices of the Newars (Gutschow, p. 338). Nevertheless, they were not beyond borrowing Mughal and Rajput design practices. For instance, the Kirtipur tower, adjacent to the Basantapur tower, has a roof in the shape of an upturned boat, similar to Mughal palace architecture.    History and Design  The history of the Basantapur tower is considerably complex. Hutt notes that some of the tower's windows and roof struts are covered over where it meets the outer edges of the neighboring Lvahancok courtyard, suggesting one monument followed the other. Gutschow clarifies this further, suggesting that the adjacent square (and its three remaining towers) was probably built a few years after the tower by Prithvi Narayan Shah or his successor. Certainly, the tower and the courtyard do not form a harmonious design, as the tower's footprint is off-kilter with the rest of the enclosure.  The building's facade and layout recall the seven-storied Sattalle Darbar in Nuwakot, among the early areas conquered by the rising Shah dynasty. As the Basantapur tower is ultimately an overgrown Newari-style temple building (at least in elevation), its brackets are abundantly decorated with figures from the Hindu pantheon, though no gods are housed inside. The exterior facade's present appearance—an elegant interplay of carved wooden forms—differs remarkably from its appearance in the early-mid 20th century, when (as the author John Sunday notes) ...every square centimeter of it was once covered in paint (Theophile and Gutschow, p. 97).  The interior spaces are wide, airy, and well-ventilated, with numerous latticed screens and balconies. To Hutt, this conjures images of Fatehpur Sikri and the Mughal palaces of Agra, which share a similar emphasis on lightness, openness, and ample internal space. The outer walls of the interior spaces are shaped in an outwardly projecting “V” configuration, meeting at a ninety-degree angle halfway between floor and ceiling. The historian Ronald M. Bernier remarks,     The experience of visiting one of the balconies is rather startling at first    for it is possible to look straight down to the street below though the sloping screens which project outward from the edge of the balcony.   (Bernier. p. 115). As the tower is not used for religious purposes, it is one of the few large-scale monuments in the valley whose interior is open to all visitors. Even today, tourists may gaze down from its dizzying heights to take in the panorama of the palace and the surrounding valley. Among the buildings visible from the top is the Kumari Bahal (to the southwest), the residence of the deified Royal Kumari, an incarnation of the goddess Durga incarnate in carefully chosen Newari girls.  The great earthquake of April 2015 collapsed three of the tower's upper levels but fortunately spared the lower stories. Restoration work was funded by China, representing the first large-scale heritage assistance provided by China for Nepal. Work was completed in late 2022, so the building again assumed its historical form as the new year dawned in 2023.  "

          "The Kumari Chhen(house) is the home of Living Goddess Kumari. The house is also called Kumari Bahal or Kumari Temple or Kumari Ghar. The Kumari Ghar temple is a house with an intricately carved golden window flanked by equally attractive wooden windows to its left and right. This building was built in 1757 by the last Malla King of Kathmandu – Jayaprakash Malla, and bestowed it to the living goddess Kumari as her living quarters.  The Kumari Chhen lies south-west of the Kathmandu Durbar Square. Both the inside and the outside of the temple is surrounded by a wide base covered with bricks and stones. They now host a resting place for passer-bys and the devotees who come to catch a glimpse of the Kumari. The three-storied chariot which is the vehicle of the Goddess is placed adjacent to Kumari Ghar. Another small chariot called the Viman Khat (meant to be carried on shoulders) is placed at the open eastern side under a small enclosure made especially for the chariot.  The ground floor of the Kumari Chhen has exquisitely carved doors. Among the three doors, only the one at the center is open. Stone steps lead to this main door. The main door has two life-size lions placed on either side as guards to both, the temple and the deity.  The northern side of the house has 22 exquisitely carved windows in various forms. One special window, the Ga Jhya directly over the main entrance is gold-plated in the centre. No one but the Kumari is supposed to look through this window. This Kumari Jhya was made by King Jaya Prakash Malla and Queen Dayalakshmi Devi according to the rituals during 1758 AD. This window is again elegantly carved with 39 flying-horses at the bottom. At the second floor is another Sa Jhya from where the Living Goddess gives a short glimpse every day to the devotees. All other windows in the Kumari Chhen are ornate and beautiful.  Inside the Kumari Ghar is an open courtyard. In a typical residential style, the Kumari Chhen has the ground floor, the first floor, the second floor and the roof. On the top floor is the grand throne of the living goddess. Set in a special room, the ornate golden throne is carved with peacock as the seat.  The house of the living goddess has walls that are artistically painted with many different religious crafts. The life-size painting of King Jaya Prakash Malla with hands folded in due respect to the goddess can also be found here. The king is shown at the right foot of the Goddess Taleju, whereas the Queen Daya Lakshmi is shown at the left foot along with Prince Jyoti Prakash Malla. These paintings portray the deep respect of the royal family to the goddess Taleju Bhawani and, ultimately, to the living goddess Kumari (who is believed to be the incarnation of Goddess Taleju).  On the top of the north face, on the roof, covered with terra cotta tiles is the pinnacle, called gajur. The gajur is the pride of the Kumari Chhen, for it holds an aura of faith and belief. Wish it had been the beauty of the house that draws visitors to Kumari Chhen every day.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "'Trailokya Mohan' means 'Vishnu of the Three Worlds'. In keeping with that theme, the roof brackets are decorated with various incarnations of Vishnu and associated deities. An alternate name for the monument is the Dasavatar Dekhaune Mandir, meaning     Temple of the Ten Incarnations of Vishnu. The memorial was built in 1679 by Parthivendra Malla to honor his dead brother, Nripendra Malla.  The Trailokya Mohan Narayan is an elegant three-tiered temple set on a five-story plinth. It occupies the south side of the square bounded on the north by the Shiva-Parvati temple, the Hanuman Dhoka palace to the east, and the Maju Dega tower to the west. While the Maju Dega and the Trailokya Mohan were both reduced to rubble by the devastating earthquake of April 2015, as of January 2023, only the Trailokya Mohan has been fully restored.    The historian Michael Hutt describes the temple as a     handsome three - tier pagoda (p. 84). The ground floor is symmetrical on each side, an enclosed brick chamber with understated wooden portals, highlighting the practice of building Narayan temples on a square plan with portals facing the cardinal directions. Around the perimeter is a colonnaded portico that allows circumambulation of the shrine chamber. However, in the modern area, locals and visitors often use the porch as a convenient place to sit.      Some years later, in 1689, Nripendra's widow Riddhi Lakshmi (and her chief minister) sponsored the installation of a votive Garuda statue, depicted kneeling in an attitude of prayer toward the Trailokya Mohan's west facade. The architectural historian Ronald Bernier praises the statue highly, noting:     Even the toes show an excellence of controlled detail and organic reality    while the face seems to be infinitely reposed with its slight smile alert eyes and prominent forehead marking.  The temple serves as the setting for dance performances depicting Vishnu's ten incarnations; the festivities are held here as part of the Indra Jatra festival.  The monument reopened in late 2022 following wholesale reconstruction, which reused numerous salvaged architectural remnants that were catalogued and set aside following the April 2015 earthquake.

      "Detailed_Description":
          "Kasthamandap is a three-storey pagoda-style temple situated in the Human Dhoka Durbar Square in heart of Kathmandu city and is believed to be built out of a single tree. The Kathmandu city is believed to be named after the temple itself. Kasthamandap means ‘wood-pavilion’.  Although its historical background regarding its origin is not certain, Kasthamandap temple is believed to be built in the 16th century by Laxmi Narsingha Malla with the woods of a single tree. The present building was renovated during the seventeenth century. The building has an idol of Gorakhnath at the center the second floor has four idols of Lord Ganesh on its four sides. Also religious texts of Ramayana and Mahabharata are inscribed on the four walls. It is opened during the mid-day until the mid-night and everyone is allowed to go inside. However, taking the photographs inside the temple is strictly prohibited.    The temple is an excellent example of the art and architecture of Nepal because of the wooden carvings and the design of the temple. To this day, the temple has stood steadily without the use of any metal nails or rivets. Kasthamandap is one of the significant cultural heritage of Nepal that stands as an example of the rich Nepali art and architectural legacy of the 12th century.    Legend has it that Saint Gorakhnath attended the chariot procession of Machhindranath in human disguise. Unfortunately, he was recognized by a tantric who cast a spell on him imprisoning him for eternity in the Kathmandu valley. Desperate to free himself from imprisonment, Gorakhnath made a deal with the tantric who needed sufficient materials for building a wooden temple. A giant Sal tree grew in his land which he (tantric) used to construct the temple of Kasthamandap. The temple is also said to have been dedicated to Gorakhnath. The idol of Gorakhnath inside the temple is somewhat confusing as he has always been represented by footprints.    Another legend is found regarding to the missing pinnacle of the temple. The builders of the temple are said to have promised the gods to erect a pinnacle as soon as the price of the oil and that of salt became an equal amount. However, that never happened and the pinnacle was never erected in the temple.  "

      "Detailed_Description":
          "The Kavindrapur Sattal stands on the east side of Maru-tol square, to the southwest of the Hanuman Dhoka Palace. Built by Pratap Malla (r. 1650-74), it has a colorful history and is known by many names: Kavīndrapura, Marunāsaḥdyaḥ, Marunāsaḥ (the local Newar dialect name), Nāsadyaḥ, and the Dhansa temple, among others.  Background and Purpose  The Kavindrapur was established as a sattal, a kind of dharmasala or public rest house for itinerant holy men and other travelers. It was functionally similar to the Kasthamandapa, an older site to the northwest destroyed in the April 2015 earthquake but now rebuilt. A third sattal—the Singha Sattal—stands on the south side of the square, making the Maru Tol the only public square in Nepal bounded on three sides by sattals.  The word     Kavindrapur means the     Mansion of Kavindra  with Kavindra referring to Pratap Malla himself, who styled himself     Lord of Poets (Kavindra). According to Michael Hutt, Pratap Malla built this monument and several others to placate Narasiṃha, whom he angered by impersonating him in a dance. Escaping the wrath of Narasiṃha—a half-man, half-lion incarnation of Vishnu—became something of an obsession for Malla, who also erected various statues of the deity throughout Kathmandu. For example, at the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, the king commissioned an image of Lord Narasiṃha depicting him slaying Hiranyakashipu, a demon with supernatural powers. The inscription on the statue's base indicates that Malla installed it as penance for impersonating the deity.    However, in an essay by Manik Bajracharya and Axel Michaels, the Narasingha incident is not even mentioned. Instead, they note that because Pratap Malla saw himself as the     Lord of Poets  it follows those one of the fourteen deities worshipped here was Nrityanātha, the god of dance and music. In Newari, the god Nrityanātha is called Nāsaḥdyaḥ, reflecting the temple's alternate name. They further note that on the back of a mid-19th century sketch by the artist Rajman Singh, the artist states that the temple was dedicated to     Nityanāth or NasaDeo  referring to Nrityanātha/Nāsaḥdyaḥ. That said, in official historiography, reflecting the position of the Guṭhi Saṃsthāna organization in Nepal, the temple is still described as dedicated to Narasiṃha.  How, then, was the Kavindrapur Sattal actually used? There are at least three possibilities:  In the     traditional interpretation, the Kavindrapur was built to placate Narasiṃha, for whom the temple was dedicated.  Supposing that the temple was dedicated to Nrityanātha, the god of dance and music, it follows that Pratap Malla as the     Lord of Poets may have used the site as a venue for poetry and dance (indeed, dances are still held here on occasion, albeit to pacify Narasiṃha.)  A third possibility (also noted by Bajracharya and Michaels) is that the site was used as a treasury. Even now, the building is sometimes called Dhansa temple, which might refer to the Nepali word dhansār, meaning     treasury.    Indeed, the site was referred to as    Dhansār or    Dunsar by several 19th-century artists, suggesting that it was widely known by that name.  It is also conceivable that the site was used for more than one function.     Architecture  Today, the temple is a three-story structure facing west, with a long facade relative to its height. Its original form was more visually balanced, as the temple's upper levels were destroyed in the 1934 earthquake and never rebuilt. Initially, the third story (an oddly wide but truncated rectangle) was much taller, similar in design to the central bay of the second story, with spacious wraparound windows. It was surmounted by a fourth level which lent the building a vaguely pyramidal appearance, each of the four floors gradually diminishing in size.   A drawing of the building before the earthquake may be seen in the sketch by Rajman Singh in 1844.   That drawing and another by the painter Henry Ambrose Oldfield (from 1857) suggest that there were once temporary stalls attached to the ground floor where goods were sold, and that—then as now—the Maru Tol square was a bustling hub of commercial activity. The ground floor was once readily accessible to the public, but has now been screened off by latticed windows.  The fine quality of the woodwork on the middle level is particularly noteworthy, especially the projecting bay windows supported by carved brackets. The age of the deities on the carved struts is unclear, but they appear to be modern reproductions. Even so, the quality of the artistry is first-rate. Also of interest is the five-part window at the center of the middle level. Of 17th-century origin, the central blind window is flanked by two functional windows with trefoil arches. The pediments are arranged in a series of gently curving horizontal tiers, creating a complex rhythm with alternating shade-and-shadow in the late afternoon sun.  "

          "The Bhagawati temple is located near the southwest corner of the Hanuman Dhoka palace compound. Facing west toward the street, it stands opposite the Shiva-Parvati or Navagdurga temple. It is one of the few structures attributable to Jagajjaya Malla, who ruled Kathmandu from 1722-36.  Reliable information on the temple is scarce as it is integrated into the west wall of the palace and, hence, is often overlooked by visitors passing at ground level. One of the few mentions of the monument is in Michael Hutt's book Nepal: A Guide to the Art and Architecture of the Kathmandu Valley. There, he relays that the structure originally housed a statue of the god Narayan which the King dubbed Mahipatindreshvar (Lord of Mahipatindra). The King named the image after the murdered King Mahipatendra Malla, who was slain despite being the great King Pratap Malla's chosen heir. As Jagajjaya Malla claimed descent from Haipatendra Malla, the founding of the Bhagawati was thus an attempt to legitimize his rule by linking it back to the illustrious reign of Pratap Malla (1641-74). Nevertheless, Jagajjaya Malla's position was somewhat insecure as the prior King, Bhaskar Malla, died without issue (of the plague) and nominated Jagajjaya to the throne.    The fate of the Narayan image is not known, as it was stolen in 1767 and never returned. In its place, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal, raised an image of Bhagawati (Durga) that he had taken from Nuwakot. Despite this, the statue is temporarily returned to its original place in Nuwakot for a short time each April--a tradition that continues today.    The temple is built as a five-level monument with two brick ground floors surmounted by three tiers of Newar-style roofs. The roofs are supported by original 18th-century brackets carved in the likeness of the various Ashta Matrikas (Mother Goddesses). The quality of the woodwork of the brackets, balconies, and window portals ranks among the finest in Kathmandu and is worth close attention. As the temple faces west and is topped by wide, four-sided roofs, it is best observed in the late afternoon when the sun illuminates the brackets and woodwork from a low angle.  "

          "The Jagannath Temple (also known as the Char Narayan) is one of the oldest monuments in Hanuman Dhoka Darbar Square. Until the late 20th century, it was wrongly believed to have been the work of King Pratap Malla (r. 1641-74), a prolific builder, as an image of Krishna (a.k.a. Jagannath) was installed during his reign. However, architectural historian Michael Hutt notes that the date 1563 appears at the base of the temple's central statue, extending its age back to the early years of Mahendra Malla's reign (r. 1560–1574). It is one of only four significant temples known to have been built in Mahendra Malla's time in the Darbar Square, the others being Kotilingeswar Mahadev, Mahendreswara, and the Taleju Temple.   General Description  The monument is a Newar-style temple built of brick and wood atop a low plinth. Similar in design to the contemporary Char Narayan in Patan, its outer walls are faced with portals, each comprising three doors and a torana. The central door on each side leads to an ambulatory surrounding a central cella, inaccessible to all but priests. Unlike similar buildings with an ambulatory, the outer passageway is blocked at the northwest and southeast corners (see plan below) to separate the tripartite east-facing shrine from the central image. More detail on the statues installed here is mentioned below.    At each of the four corners, set apart from the main building, are small two-tiered subsidiary towers, foretelling the pancayatana layout of the 19th-century Tripureshwar Mahadev temple. In addition to Vishnu, the pancayatana arrangement furnishes smaller shrines for Mahadeva, Ganesa, Surya, and Durga.  The ground floor—measuring 8.3 meters on each side—is topped with two tiers of roofs supported by carved wooden brackets, 48 in all, that depict deities with four heads and eight arms. Niels Gutschow remarks that the lower tier represents the twenty-four forms of Vishnu (caturvimsatimurti). The carvings are of superb quality, though some are considerably damaged. Ronald Bernier, the art historian, describes the struts as    perhaps the best to be found in the palace square  (Bernier, p. 126).   Below each bracket are friezes of lesser quality that depict various erotic activities involving people and animals. Bernier dismisses these scenes as being ...a minor part of the struts and do not reveal the artistry of the major figures being unworthy of the attention so often lavished on them by foreign visitors (Bernier, p. 126). The carvings are less prominent now than they must have appeared to Bernier in the 1970s, as they were once brightly painted. As of 2022, the scenes are now monochrome. It is uncertain if the bright coloration was removed or if they were replaced at some point in the past fifty years.  Purpose of the Temple and Identity of Deities  The purpose of the temple appears to have changed over the years. The central image, dating to 1563, is of Chaturmukhi Vishnu, a four-headed deity representing Vishnu's four vyuhas (manifestations). These include Vasudeva (Krishna), Samkarshana (Balarama), Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Hutt suggests the image may be a copy of a much older statue dating to the 6th or 7th century that still exists at the Narayan Hiti temple. A century later, in Pratap Malla's time, the King added images of Krishna (Jagannath), Subhadra (Jagannath's sister), and Balabhadra (Jagannath's brother) [2]. This may have been an attempt to create a substitute for the great Jagannath temple at Puri, in Orissa, India, which stands 875 kilometers due south of Kathmandu. Puri was regarded as one of the     Four    Abodes  or Char Dham, representing the four corners of India. The other     corners  included:  The Rameswaram temple in Tamil Nadu, in the deep south.  The Dwarka temple in Gujarat, in western India.  The Badrinath temple in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, in northern India.  Such locations were broadly inaccessible to 17th-century Nepalis. In spite of the difficulty reaching them—or perhaps for that reason—it became a mark of distinction for Nepal's elite to undertake pilgrimages to the real Puri, an arduous journey. For example, Siddhinarasim Malla of Patan visited Puri in the 1660s, followed by Jagatprakasa Malla from Bhaktapur in 1670. Gutschow argues that the impetus for the identification with Jagannath was the fragmentation of the Ganga dynasty in Orissa, which counted Jagannath as its tutelary state deity (rastradevata). Following the Ganga's collapse, numerous principalities in the area began funding Jagannath temples near their palaces, perhaps to bask vicariously in the glory of the vanished Ganga dynasty.   The creation of     substitute  shrines in Nepal in place of distant Indian monuments is well-attested. To give but one example, the Gopinath Krishna temple of Bhaktapur was another attempt to replicate one of the 'Four Abodes.'  Reconstructions and Restorations  The temple retains many original elements but was reconstructed multiple times over the centuries to correct for periodic earthquakes. Gutschow highlights construction anomalies—such as colonnettes ending in mid-air—suggesting the temple collapsed in the earthquake of 1833. About a century later, the quake of 1934 required the renewal of both roofs and the replacement of much of the brick veneer on the ground floor. Fortunately, the temple survived the last major earthquake—in April 2015—but suffered     twisting  of the upper superstructure, resulting in large cracks across the upper-level facades and displacement of the struts. The damage has since been repaired. "

          "Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple, as the name suggests, has been devoted to the holy Hindu god – five faced Hanuman. King Pratap Malla was very spiritual and tantrik in nature. He had built this temple – as one of the chaukwath in the courtyard – to pray his offerings to the monkey god as well as perform and practice his tantrik practices and meditations  On the north western corner of the Hanumandhoka Palace lies the five roofed unique round Pagoda style temple – Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple. It’s five storeyes are decked in red and gold, and they’ve been dedicated to Pancha Mukhi Hanuman (Five faced Hanuman). The temple is believed to have been built somewhere around 1655AD by King Pratap Malla as a shrine to practice his acts of spirituality. King Pratap Malla has been speculated throughout history to have been a very spiritual ruler.    Astonishingly, the Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple didn’t face much repercussions compared to the fate of other temples in the palace premises after the devastating earthquake of 2015. Spurred by an understanding by the Hanuman Dhoka committee that this unique five-tiered temple had become fundamentally unstable over the years, the restoration project was underway before the earthquake, with funds in place, although the physical reconstruction work had not yet begun in April 2015 when the earthquake struck. Due to the hard-work and the fortuitous circumstances of having cash in hand, the work on fortifying and restoring the Panchmukhi Hanuman temple began in earnest in September, 2015 after following all legal procedures such as allocating the contract to the lowest bidder (according to government rules), as well as a rigorous research process that defined the parameters within which the three Steering, Consultative, and Working Committees moved in concert to execute the multi-pronged (research, re-construction, monitoring, documentation) approach required for a successful restoration. Currently, the temple is towering as it did on its prime.  "

          "The Taleju Temple ranks among the oldest monuments in Hanuman Dhoka Darbar Square. Old notebooks (tyasaphus) record the construction of a     large temple  during the reign of Mahendra Malla in 1564 (r. 1560-74). It is one of four significant monuments known to have been built in Mahendra Malla's time in Durbar Square, the others being the Jagannath, Kotilingeswar Mahadev, and Mahendreswara temples. The Malla-era building spree was funded by the kingdom's efforts to mint Tibetan coins for export and boost trade with neighbouring Himalayan kingdoms.  Taleju and Māneśvarī  The temple enshrines Taleju Bhawani, the Malla lineage deity and the Newar people's patron goddess. Taleju was also revered by the Malla kings in Patan and Bhaktapur, where separate temples were built in her honor. According to the traditional view, this goddess, who originated in South India, supplanted the role of Māneśvarī—another goddess—at the beginning of the 14th century. She was introduced to Nepal by Harisingh Deva (a.k.a. Harisimhadeva, r. 1304-25), the forefather of the Malla dynasty. However, scholars such as Mary Slusser note that ...Harisimha died a broken refugee in the pestilential Tarai and had nothing to do directly with bringing the goddess from Mithila (Slusser, p. 318; see note). They further note that rather than being supplanted, Māneśvarī was assimilated into the cult of Taleju.  Taleju's esoteric mantra was thought to ensure uninterrupted royal rule and was passed from one king to his successor only when death appeared imminent. This occasionally caused difficulty, such as when the insane and imprisoned Lakshmi Narasimha Malla was unwilling—or unable—to pass along the mantra to his son, Pratap Malla (r. 1641-74). Taleju then threatened to abandon Nepal but was persuaded to stay by tantrist adepts. However, some sources, such as the famous Wright chronicle, suggest the mantra was forever lost.  As noted by the architectural historian Niels Gutschow, a 19th-century chronicle remarked that Taleju appeared to Mahendra Malla in the form of a bee and entered the temple around 1550. While most Malla kings honored Taleju and were pleased with her presence, she occasionally received blame for unfortunate events. The temple was also the site of at least one conspiracy. Ronald Bernier, the architectural historian, notes that the Gunpowder Plot of 1769 was planned on the grounds of the temple. A few decades later, King Rana Bahadur Shah, reeling with grief at the suicide of his queen—who had been disfigured by a smallpox epidemic—ordered the main Taleju image defiled and crushed. His subjects, angered by the sacrilege, forced him to abdicate in favor of his son, who restored Taleju to her place of honor. The goddess remains today as a touchstone of Newar identity, and her presence is felt throughout the city.   Later History  The monument's original layout is unknown, other than it was a     large    temple (tava devara). Gutschow believes that King Pratap Malla had it extensively renovated in the 1650s or 1660s. A scroll painting from that period records a ceremony held for Prince Cakravartinda, depicting the monument as a three-tiered structure set upon a multi-stage plinth, among other details. The king continued to patronize the temple throughout his reign, adding the gilt copper paneling still seen on the doors. His children and, later, his widow also funded several small renovations through the year 1700.  On the basis of stylistic evidence, Gutschow believes another renovation of the ground floor level took place as early as the 18th century and possibly as late as the early 19th century. As evidence, he notes that certain details—such as the presence of secondary colonnettes—were not typical until the second half of the 19th century. For a complete treatment of these stylistic clues, which are highly technical, readers are recommended to consult Gutschow's The Portals in Newar Architecture.    According to Ulrich Wiesner, the temple was unharmed in the earthquakes of 1810 and 1833. Following the 1934 earthquake, which tilted the gajura finial out of alignment, a renovation was undertaken in 1939. Fortunately, the temple was not seriously damaged in the next great earthquake to strike Kathmandu in April 2015.   Form  The current layout of the temple resembles a cosmic mandala. The main building, with three tiers of roofs, stands upon a twelve-stepped base recalling the lower slopes of Mount Meru. Around the sanctuary are sixteen satellite shrines designed as two-level Newar-style towers. Notably, the roofs of the main building are covered by gilt copper sheets and are supported by carved wooden struts depicting a variety of deities. Four portals provide entrances to the temple—one on each side—each containing one proper door and two false doors. Each is heavily articulated with carved wooden colonnettes, toranas over the central entrances, and pointed blocks (bhailahkva) flanking the lower door jambs.    The temple's perimeter is surrounded by a high wall through which—for most of the year—no one may enter except priests. However, this proscription is relaxed slightly during the Indra Jatra when Hindus and Buddhists are allowed to enter the compound via the Singha Dhoka (Lion Gate), adjacent to the Kageshwor Mahadev temple. That gate was the work of Pratap Malla in 1663.  "

According to legend, the shrine was found at a paddy field and later it was placed at the Durbar Square by King Pratap Malla. Kala Bhairav is believed to have been sculptured from a single stone. The 12-foot-high stone image of Kala Bhairav which is enshrined in the temple is said to have been sculpted in the 5th or 6th century and was later rediscovered in a paddy field in the 17th century by King Pratap Malla.  The image of Kala Bhairava is situated in the Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square premises in Kathmandu is said to be the largest image of the Lord and is also considered as one of the powerful temples in Kathmandu valley. Legend has it that the temple served as a supreme court in Nepal for a long time as the people believed that the person who lied in front of the sculpture would be dead by the powers of the Lord. The image of the lord is black in colour, as its name suggests, Kala means black or dark and is worshipped everyday by the people living in the area and also, those who happen to pass by the image make sure to bow and pay their respects to the Lord.    Kala Bhairav is one of the most dangerous forms of Lord Shiva and among the various forms of Bhairav, Kala Bhairav is the most perilous one. The literal meaning of Kala is ‘time’ or ‘death’, hence, Kala Bhairav is also considered as the ‘Lord of time or death’. Considered as the guru of the planetary deity Shani (Saturn), Kala Bhairav is often depicted carrying the decapitated head of Brahma as it is said that the guilt of cutting out one of the five heads of Brahma made him carry the head and roam around as mendicant for several years until he was absolved of the sin.  The lord is often depicted wearing ornaments of twisted serpents, tiger skin and a ritual apron made of human bones. The day of Bhairava Ashtami which falls on Krishnapaksha Ashtami of the Margashirsha month of the Hindu calendar is said to be the day when Lord Kala Bhairav had appeared on earth centuries ago. The day is celebrated with special prayers and rituals around the temple of the Lord.  "

          "This is one of the big temples in the Hanuman Dhoka Darbar complex. The three-storied temple is built on a three-tiered box. In the sanctum sanctorum of the temple there is an idol of Vishnu with Lakshmi called 'Maha Vishnu'. The statue has the faces of not only Vishnu, but many avatars. Vahumukhi Vishnu idols of this nature are also called as Maha Vishnu, Trailokyamohan, Panchamukhi Lakshminarayan, Vaikuntha Vishnu etc. (Pruscha 1975, p.54, S. Mainālī VS 187, G. Vajrācārya VS 2033, 78). The presence of Lakshmi is also shown along with Vishnu. The statue is completely made of gold-plated metal. An idol of this nature is also present in the temple near Kumarighar in the Hanumandhoka complex. Apart from the shardul of the temple, other tundals are of simple nature without butta. All the three roofs are using jingti and golden gajur is spread on the upper part.  There is no record here that can be ascertained by whom and when this temple was built. According to G. Vajrācārya (VS 2033, 78), this temple was built in memory of Rajendra Malla, the eldest son of Jagajjaya Malla. Balagopal, the priest of the temple at that time, found a jantar inside the original Vishnumurti, on which Jagajjay Malla was written, and in a note dated 1887, Jagajjay Malla built a 37 cubits high temple in front of Hanumandho's palace in memory of Rajendra. From the photographs taken before the 1990 (1934) earthquake, the initial three-storied form of this temple is known. The golden Vishnu Murti inside the earthquake-hit temple was moved to the eastern corridor of Nasal Chowk for safety and is currently (January 2013) safe in the same place. After the earthquake, the normal two-storied temple was raised as can be seen in the photograph published by Pruscha (1975, p.54) and the idol inside the temple was not restored. Based on the old photo, a plan has been started to reconstruct it in its original form around the year 2059 (year 2003). The Department of Archeology completed the work in collaboration with KVPT. During this reconstruction, although the door, shardul, window, etc. were made buttedar, due to confusion about which gods and goddesses should be placed in the tundal, the tundals were kept plain (priest of the temple, Bhaṭṭa, male, age 54). After the temple was built in its original form, efforts were made to restore the original idol placed inside Nasal Chowk. But as it was decided to make a replica instead of that idol, the sanctum sanctorum was completed by making a new idol (priest of the temple, Bhaṭṭa, male, age 54). A Bhatt family from Kathmandu has been performing the ancestral role for the purpose of daily worship in the temple. Currently (January 2023) according to priest Vasudev Bhatt, there is a provision of small income from Kaushitosa food and Guthi Sansthan. Since the original idol of the past is in Nasal Chowk, the old idol is also worshiped daily along with the new idol of the temple.This is also one of the few heritage sites in the valley that have been tried to return to their original form based on old photographs. Based on the photo evidence before the earthquake of 1990 (year 1934), the temple, which has disappeared, has been reconstructed after seven decades."

          "The Narayana (or Vishnu) Temple at Darbar Square in Kathmandu is a stunning three-tiered monument perched atop a four-level base. The temple, which is believed to have been built in the late 17th or early 18th century, underwent a major restoration by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) in 2003, which returned it to its original appearance. The temple had previously been altered due to the 1934 earthquake and a subsequent reconstruction in the late 1930s that shortened its roof brackets. The KVPT restoration involved extending the roof brackets to their original length.  The architectural historian Niels Gutschow remarks that this temple's layout     represents the most common temple type which evolved from the early 17 th century on.   (Gutschow, p. 481). Most Narayana temples, like this one, are built upon a square plan with four symmetrical portals. Its ground-floor cella features a Vishnu image, which Gutschow suggests is the original idol; he remarks that Misra Brahmins conduct daily worship from the nearby Maru neighborhood. The deity (not shown, as photography is not permitted) is often mistakenly thought to be Krishna as it once held a flute in two of its hands, though the flute has gone missing.  The bracketing of the lower roof is exceptional. Michael Hutt notes,    an unusual feature is that almost all of the figures at the base of the struts are women but not goddesses  (Hutt, p. 95). He tentatively identifies them as gopinis. Gutschow describes them as     caryatid - like supporting apsaras (Gutschow, p. 481). The space between the brackets is not hollow in the usual way, but is filled with a wooden latticework screen. The deities forming the bulk of the brackets are more human-like than the norm, as each has ‘only’ two hands.  The three-story tall temple may appear impressive from the outside, but the interior is only inhabitable on the ground floor. The base features a square cellar, topped with an interior ceiling, while the upper levels are purely decorative and inaccessible. Regrettably, the windows on the second and third floors are functional, creating an inviting opening for pigeons and bats.  The walls on the uppermost tier are set back from the main brick bearing walls, running from the top of the plinth to above the middle-tier windows. The wooden framework supporting the third-tier walls is visible from the exterior. While this design is not uncommon, it presents a unique engineering challenge as the entire upper level, including its heavy load-bearing walls, rests solely on wooden beams that transfer their load to the double-height brick wall extending from the plinth.

The column was erected in 1670 by Pratap Malla and preceded the similar columns in Patan and Bhaktapur.  His image can also be seen in the niche above the Hanuman Dhoka Palace gate. The niche above the gate is Krishna in his ferocious tantric aspect, flanked by more gentle, amorous Krishna surrounded by gopinis, and by King Pratap Malla playing a lute, and his queen.  The establishment of the statue of Hanuman (Monkey God devotee of Lord Ram) at the main entrance was in 792 Nepali Era (1729 B.S.) by king Pratap Malla, the name of the palace came to be Hanumandokha durbar since then. After, Prithivi Narayan Shah concurred Kathmandu valley in 1825 B.S. he had the Basantapur Durbar built & the place was also reffered as Basantapur Durbar Square.   The octagonal Krishna Temple was built in 1648–49 by Pratap Malla, either as a response to rival Siddhinarshingh Malla's Krishna Temple in Patan or as a religious consolation for his earlier failure to conquer that city, or in memory of his two wives, or a combination of all three.    Pratap Malla (1624–74 A.D.) was a Malla king and the eighth King of Kantipur from 1641 until his death in 1674. He attempted to unify Kathmandu Valley by conquering Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, but failed in the effort. He was successful in extending and securing the borders of Kantipur and was responsible for the monopoly over trade with Tibet. The resulting prosperity was responsible for the construction of majority of the buildings around Durbar Square during his reign. His reign is seen as a cultural and economic high point of the Malla dynasty.    Pratap Malla had two queens: the first being a Maithali lady of Southern Nepal and the second being a sister of Zil-gnon dbang-rgyal rdo-rje, a prominent Tibetan Buddhist guru, who had served as an advisor to him.[2] Some modern historians have given him the reputation for being lewd and maintaining a harem. He is also alleged to have raped a virgin girl, which ultimately resulted in her death. Pratap Malla is said to have repented this act so much so that he wanted to absolve himself of his sins and consulted the wise and learned men on the matter. Acting on their suggestions, he set up hundreds of Lingas at Pashupati and installed a statue of his own with his two queens. He also performed Koti Hom, weighed gold on one scale and himself on the other and gave it away in charity. In order to commemorate the occasion, he also raised a pillar on the southern gate of Pashupati, and established a grazing ground near the area.    He often fought with Lalitpur and Bhaktapur to annex them to his kingdom but could not succeed. He tried to play the kings of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur against each other. Sometimes he sided with Bhaktapur and posed a menace to Lalitpur. Sometimes he sided with Lalitpur and fell upon Bhaktapur. His main aim was to annex Lalitpur to Kathmandu. But his aim was not fulfilled as the king of Lalitpur had the king of Gorkha, Ram Shah, as his ally. Moreover, Shree Nivas, son of Siddhi Nara Singha was no less inferior to Pratap Malla in courage and diplomacy. In 1634 A.D., when Siddhi Nara Singha Malla was engaged in performing Koti Hom, Pratap Malla availing himself of the opportunity, made a surprise attack on Patan and conquered some of the places important from the strategic point of view. Dambar Shah, son of Ram Shah had come with a contingent to help Siddhi Nara Singh Malla, but his troops were waylaid and put to rout. Pratap Malla gave a lot of trouble to Narendra Malla, King of Bhaktapur. He made Narendra Malla pay tribute to him in the form of elephants. Later, again he sided with Shree Niwas Malla and laid a siege on Bhaktapur. He plundered Bhaktapur and carried away many valuables. But when Lalitpur sided with Bhaktapur, Pratap Malla signed a treaty with Bhaktapur.    Pratap Malla was a lover of literature. He himself was a poet. He gave himself the title of     Kavindra.    Kavindra means     the King of poets . He was tolerant of all religions. He was fond of building temples. He set up an image of Hanuman beside his palace. Since then, the palace is called     Hanuman Dhoka . Besides this, he built a temple of Krishna with the image of Kala Bhairav in front of Hanuman Dhoka and a temple of Guheshwari. He offered a gold umbrella to Pashupatinath temple. He had great respect for Buddhism. He introduced Seto Machchhindranath Jatra.  "

There are several images of this mythical bird scattered all over Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, but perhaps the most well-known is the Statue of Garuda inside Kathmandu Durbar Square.  Both of Durbar Square’s Shiva and Vishnu Temples have images of Garuda. In Narayan Temple, the Garuda appears at the entrance of the temple perched on a high pillar. It is planked by the sankha and chakra symbols of Vishnu. Many of the Garuda images scattered in Nepal’s hundreds of temples and shrines are tiny and almost unrecognizable.  "
